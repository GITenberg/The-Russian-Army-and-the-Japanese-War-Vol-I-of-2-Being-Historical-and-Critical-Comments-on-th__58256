<h2>TRANSLATORâS PREFACE</h2>

<p>âThe General stands higher than any other Russian officer, not only
in Russian opinion, but in that of professional soldiers all the world
over, and if any human agency can change the deplorable situation to
Russiaâs advantage, Kuropatkin may be the man to do it.â<a
name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This sentence, written by the military
correspondent of the <i>Times</i> in February, 1904, well expresses the
sentiment that predominated when General Kuropatkinâs appointment to
command the Russian army in Manchuria was announced.</p>

<p>âIt may be that a military genius would have overcome the moral and
physical difficulties we had to encounter. Possibly; but an Alexeieff,
a Kuropatkin, a Linievitch, a Grippenberg, a Kaulbars, and a Bilderling
were unable to do so,â<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> were the words used by the
General himself two years later when reporting to his Sovereign.</p>

<p>Though these two quotations epitomize the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
<i>raison dâÃªtre</i> and tendency of this book, they by no means afford
a complete description of its scope. Were it nothing but an
<i>apologia</i>, not even the former reputation and position of its
author would save it from the neglect which invariably awaits the
excuses of the man who has failed. But it is no mere <i>apologia</i>.
For, apart from its tone of disappointment, apart from the dominant
note of failure which is current throughout, and the explanations and
reasons repeated on almost every page, the work is one long-continued
protest. It is a protest from first to last that the war was notâas far
as Russia was concernedâfought to anything like a finish; that it was
brought to a premature conclusion; that peace was declared at the
moment when victory lay within Russiaâs grasp, when her strength was at
its greatest, and that of her enemy had begun to ebb. Whether true or
otherwise, this view should not be rejected without consideration as
the natural cry of an unsuccessful party. These pages give food for
thought; they, moreover, contain much that has hitherto rested in
obscurity with regard to the attitude of the Russian War Ministry, its
efforts to prevent the war, its general policy, and other matters.</p>

<p>The author endeavours to drive home his protest by marshalling an
array of facts, and by analogy from the military history of his country
for more than two centuries. Whether he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
proves his case is for the reader to judge. Be that as it may, his book
must claim attention as being the absolute opinion of the one man on
the Russian side best qualified to throw light upon the causes and
course of the greatest world-disturbing international struggle that has
taken place for more than a third of a century. It has also a
sentimental interest in that it is the utterance of one who, after a
long and meritorious career in his countryâs service, and after holding
the highest appointments his profession offered, has failed and retired
discredited into the depths of the country. Whether he will reappear in
public life or not is unknown; but when his distinguished services for
Russia are called to mind, and a few of the stupendous difficulties
with which he had to contend in this last campaign are realized, it is
impossible to withhold sympathy.</p>

<p>The son of a Russian provincial official, Alexei Nicolaevitch
Kuropatkin was born on March 17, 1845. After being educated in the
cadet corps and the Pavlovsk War School, he was, at the age of
eighteen, posted as a Lieutenant to the 1st Turkestan Rifle Battalion,
with which he saw active service in Central Asia. Having passed with
success through the Staff College, and being graded as Staff Captain,
he in 1874 accompanied a French expedition into the Sahara. In 1876 he
took part in the Central Asian Campaign of that year, being on
Skobeleffâs staff, winning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
many laurels, and being wounded. During the Turkish War of 1877â78 he
was Chief of the Staff, and was again wounded. In the Akhal Tekhe
Expedition of 1880â81 he once more distinguished himself, commanding
the Turkestan Rifle Brigade, and being twice wounded at the storming of
Geok-Tepe. From 1883â90 he was General in Charge of strategical
questions on the great General Staff. In 1890 he reached the rank of
Lieutenant-General, and from that year till 1898 did valuable service
as Commander-in-Chief of the Trans-Caspian Military District. In 1898
he received his portfolio as Minister of War, which position he filled
until February 20, 1904, when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of
the Manchurian Army of Operations (having been promoted to General of
Infantry in 1900). On March 27, 1904, he reached Liao-yang to take up
his duties, and after several battles, in which the Russians were
almost invariably defeated, he was, in March, 1905, superseded in the
chief command by General Linievitch. Henceforward he continued to serve
on in a subordinate position in command of the 1st Army until the end
of the war. After peace was concluded, he remained in Manchuria
superintending the demobilization of the Russian forces, proceeding, on
the completion of this duty, to his country seat in Russia, where he
has since remained in retirement. It was during his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
stay in Manchuria, after hostilities had ceased, and later at his home,
that he wrote this book, with the assistance acknowledged by him in the
introduction. Its publication in Russia was suppressed almost as soon
as the book appeared, and it is believed that the subject-matter of
this translation was never printed in Russia. Of the four volumes of
the original work, the fourth has alone been translated, and is now
presented to the British public in these pages.<a name="FNanchor_3"
id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Among the many facts presented to us by the author there are some
which call for special reference. The first point to claim our
attention is the fact that though General Kuropatkin was
Commander-in-Chief of an army engaged in active operations in the
field, he was for a long time not supreme. Indeed, from the day he
arrived at Liao-yang until October 25, 1904, he was subordinate to an
officer not actually at the front, being appointed as <i>assistant</i>
(the italics are ours) to the ViceroyâAdmiral Alexeieffâwhose
headquarters were at Harbin. Curiously enough, General Kuropatkin says
very little upon this subject. He merely points out that he was really
in supreme command only for four and a half months of the warâbetween
Admiral Alexeieffâs departure and his own supersession by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
General Linievitchâand incidentally mentions various actions and orders
of the Viceroy which forced him to act against his own judgment. How
detrimental such control must have been to the conduct of operations
needs no emphasis. It is not within the scope of this preface to
attempt criticism or justification of the Russian strategy or conduct
of the warâbe it that of General Kuropatkin or anotherâbut such a
vicious system of command may account for much that has hitherto
appeared inexplicable. Other points which stand out are: the absolute
unreadiness of Russia, the causes which led her into hostilities in
spite of this unreadiness, the overwhelming nature of the advantage
gained by Japan with the command of the sea, the drag upon Russiaâs
strategy constituted by the fortress of Port Arthur, and the fear of
complications on the western frontier, which forced her to retain her
best troops in Europe. The handicap that her inferior railway
communications were to her arms is obvious, and less remarkable than
the immense improvement in them effected during the course of
hostilities.</p>

<p>Of the authorâs opinions, that of most interest to his own
countrymen is probably the one we have already mentionedâthat the war
was, for Russia, prematurely concluded. To us, however, the value
attached by him to a ânationalâ war as opposed to an âarmyâ war is
instructive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
while the forethought and care with which the possible price of Empire
in the twentieth century was worked out by the Russian War Ministry is
enlightening, for who has estimated the probable cost in blood and
treasure of the expansion or maintenance of the British Empire during
the next hundred years? His views also as to the correct policy to be
pursued by Russia on the Afghan and Persian frontiers, and generally
with regard to Great Britain in India and the Middle East, are
certainly important.</p>

<p>One last point, and one which is much to the credit of General
Kuropatkin, is that he was able to follow where he had once led, and
after having been in supreme command, was content to accept a
subordinate position, and do his duty in it, rather than return to
Russia before the war was over. It is refreshing to find no word of
repining over his supersession, nor any direct or indirect complaint of
his treatment by his Sovereign.</p>

<p>These pages are an exact translation of the portion of the work
comprised within them. The only liberty that has been taken with the
original is that some of the frequent repetitionsâof which the author
is a past masterâand certain passages which are nothing but long lists
of names and places, have been eliminated. There is still much
repetition in the translation, but this has been allowed to remain, in
order that the English version might adhere as closely as possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
the shape of the original. As the translation had to be made mostly
from a faint carbon copy of typescript, the work was attended with
considerable difficulties. The many faults in style and arrangement can
perhaps be explained by the fact that the original had evidently not
been corrected in proof by the author. The fact, also, that no copies
of the maps referred to by the writer (if such exist) have been
available has added very much to the difficulty of the cartography of
this translation. As the Russian system of transliterating the
place-names in Manchuria differs considerably from that used by the
English, French, German, or Japanese, it has been impossible without
large-scale Russian maps to identify every village or locality
mentioned in the narrative. Those that have been fixed are shown on the
maps that have been prepared, and in all cases, whether a place has
been located or not, the name hasâas far as possibleâbeen spelled
according to âWadeâs System of Transliteration.â<a name="FNanchor_4"
id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> By
this means it is hoped that, when better English maps become available,
some of the places not at present identifiable may be located. The
large map is a reprint of that issued with vol. ii. of the âOfficial
History of the Russo-Japanese War,â and has been used by the permission
of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Controller of H.M. Stationery Office. A list of the most important
actions, showing their names spelled according to the Russian and
English methods, has been added.</p>

<p>In order to elucidate certain references to the Russian troops and
to the mobilization of the military districts, it may not be out of
place to give briefly the system of mobilization which existed in
Russia in 1904. The law of universal military service has existed in
that country for many years, and when war broke out with Japan recruits
were enlisted from the age of twenty for twenty-three yearsâ service in
the army, of which five were passed in the regular army, thirteen in
the reserve, and five in the militia. The period in the reserve was
divided into two âcategories.â The 1st Category comprised those
recently passed into the reserve, and the 2nd the older men. If a
âgeneralâ mobilization were ordered, the 1st Category reservists of all
districts were the first to be summoned to rejoin the colours. In case
of a âpartialâ mobilization, however, the mobilization was by districts
instead of categories, and in such a case men of both categories were
to be ordered up from certain districts. The latter was the system
employed in the war against Japan. The authorities, for reasons
explained in the book, hesitated to employ the system of general
mobilization, and so denude European Russia of all the 1st Category
reservists. They therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
drew largely on the older men. The unfortunate results of this action
are made clear by General Kuropatkin. Again, as regards the troops sent
from European Russia, a distinction must be made between
âreinforcementsâ and âdrafts.â The former term has been used to signify
formed units sent to the front; the latter term is applied to bodies of
men despatched to make good the wastage as required.</p>

<h2 id="AUTHORs_INTRODUCTION">AUTHORâS INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the first three volumes<a name="FNanchor_5"
id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of
my work accounts are given of the three principal battles of the
warâLiao-yang, the Sha Ho, and Mukden. Though compiled from the best
information obtainable, it is impossible for such a book to be entirely
free from inaccuracies; for not only is our knowledge of what was done
by the Japanese extremely limited, but it is derived from unofficial
sources. At the time these volumes were written, moreover, there were
few reports available from our own individual corps and armies, and
what we had were sketchy in character. The most complete information,
on the whole, was that given in the regimental reports, upon which we
almost entirely depended; but even these were far from perfect.
Commanding officers naturally have a soft spot in their hearts for
their own troops, and the separate narratives gave very different
accounts of what was done by units of one and the same division or army
corps. Great importance has therefore been attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
such documents as copies of written orders for operations, dispositions
and marches, casualty lists, and ammunition returns. Not that the
latter could be accepted without careful scrutiny, as the ammunition
lost on the march was often included in the total rounds fired. But, in
spite of the admitted incompleteness and the partiality of the sources
of information, the facts narrated in my first three volumes present
ample material whereby to gauge the <i>moral</i>, the tactical fitness,
and the armament of our troopsâin short, to judge of the readiness of
our army for war.</p>

<p>The account of the battle of Liao-yang was written in Manchuria by
Colonel Ilinski, of the General Staff, who was then on my staff, and
was sent in November, 1904, to headquarters in St. Petersburg. This
narrative, supplemented by additional material from the pen of the
author, forms the first volume. The second, âThe Battle of the Sha Ho,â
was drawn up under my guidance in Manchuria by Colonel Bolkhovitinoff,
of the General Staff. The third, âThe Battle of Mukden,â and the
fourth, âThe Summary of the War,â I wrote myself, the former in
Manchuria and the latter at my country home. For the collection of
material, the compilation of statistics, and most of the cartography
for the third volume, I am indebted to Colonel Sivers and
Lieutenant-Colonel Havrilits, of the General
Staff, whilst Lieutenant-Colonel Krimoff, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
same branch, has undertaken this work for the fourth volume. Without
the able and unremitting efforts of these officers, the completion and
printing of this book, consisting of 2,000 pages, with plates, maps,
and plans, would have dragged on for years.</p>

<p>Although the ordeal of war through which our country and our army
passed in 1904â1905 is now a matter of history, the materials so far
collected are insufficient to enable us to estimate fairly the events
which preceded the war, or to give a detailed and complete explanation
of the defeats that we sustained. It is essential, however, that we
should take immediate advantage of our recent experience, because it is
only by ascertaining the nature of our mistakes and the failings of our
troops that we can learn how to improve.</p>

<p>In times past, when wars were carried on by small standing armies,
defeat did not touch the everyday interests of the whole nation so
profoundly as it does now, when the obligation to render military
service is general, and most of the soldiers are drawn from the great
mass of the people. If a war is to be successful in these days, it must
not be carried on by an army, but by an armed nation. In such a contest
all classes are seriously affected, and failure is more acutely felt
than it was formerly. When the national pride has been humiliated by
defeat, attempts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
are usually made to ascertain the causes and persons responsible. Some
attribute failure to general, others to specific, reasons; while some
blame the system or the rÃ©gime, others blame the individual.
Discontented political factions are quick to make use of a national
disaster as a weapon against the Government, and so with us the party
hostile to the Russian Government not only strove to injure it after
the war, but did soâmuch to the disadvantage of our armsâduring the
actual course of military operations. This party would indeed have been
genuinely glad to see us suffer defeat, as there would then have been a
hope of undermining the prestige of the Government, and so bringing
about a revolution. Their motto was, âThe worse things areâthe better,â
and hundreds of thousands of proclamations were distributed among the
troops going to the frontâespecially those from the westâurging the
soldiers on to defeat, not victory. In Russia many journals, though not
the organs of the above party, contributed materially to its success by
abusing both the army and the Government. Again, many of the
correspondents at the front, ill-informed as to our own operations, and
worse informed as to the enemyâs, did not scruple to despatch reports
founded on entirely unreliable information, and so, by exaggerating the
importance of every reverse, shook public confidence still more. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
officers, too, wrote home from the field,<a name="FNanchor_6"
id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
tried to show their smartness by hasty criticism, by making inaccurate
statements, and by discussing affairs in a pessimistic tone. Little was
written of what really happened in the actual fighting-lineâof the
deeds of those many heroes who lay face to face with the enemy for
months together, and fought on without losing confidence in eventual
victory. The gallant private soldiers, modest young officers,
commanders of companies, squadrons, batteries, and regiments, did not
writeâthey had no time to scribble of their labours and exploitsâand
there were few pressmen who elected to witness their deeds: it would
have entailed sharing their hardships and their dangers.</p>

<p>Of course, there were brave men among the correspondents, and men
who were genuinely desirous of rendering assistance; but, lacking as
they were in the most elementary military knowledge, their efforts
were, not unnaturally, of little value where complicated operations
were concerned. The persons really most capable of forming a judgment
upon what they saw, and of putting matters in their proper light before
the reading public, were the foreign military attachÃ©s. Many of them
were in every sense picked men. They were interested in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
soldiers, shared all their dangers and hardships, and, in return,
gained their affection and respect. But while none of their reports
were seen in Russia for a long time, many of our Press correspondents,
who stayed in the rear and saw only the reverse side of war, revelled
in harrowing accounts of the orgies and dissipation that went on in
Harbin, and presented to the public an absolutely distorted picture of
the life of the army. The result was that our Press to a great extent
played into the hands of our foreign and domestic enemies; instead of
which, it might have called into being with the news of our first
defeats a wave of patriotism and self-sacrifice, and, as the
difficulties at the front grew thicker, might have appealed to the
Fatherland for fresh efforts, cheered the faint-hearted, and summoned
all the best of the countryâs manhood to fill the gaps in our ranks
caused by the enemy. What it did accomplish was to instil a hatred of
the war into the masses, depress those departing for the front,
undermine the private soldierâs confidence in his officers, and weaken
the authority of those in command. Truly the army had little
encouragement to issue victoriously from its difficulties. On the
contrary, the troops sent forward from Russia carried with them the
seeds of fresh disaster in the seditious proclamations with which they
were loaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>A large number of valuable works upon different subjects suggested
by the late war have appeared, many of them written with a sincere
desire to do justice to the army; but, owing to ignorance of what
really happened, they contain numerous and serious mistakes. Passions
are now calming down, and it is possible to separate into different
categories the charges levelled at our forces and their representatives
during and after the war. These accusations, in so far as they refer to
the War Department, were mainly as follows:</p>

<p>That the army was not ready for war with Japan.</p>

<p>That, having taken insufficient steps to prepare for war, the War
Department did not attempt to prevent it.</p>

<p>That the leaders of the army did not make the best use of the men
and material placed at their disposal during its course.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour in my fourth volume both to refute these
accusations conclusively and to emphasize the principal lessons for our
future guidance to be drawn from the campaign.</p>

<p>The work of the War Ministry of an Empire like ours ought not to be
of a haphazard nature. Its success must depend on the amount of money
allotted to military needs and the manner of expenditure of these
funds. The country spends large sums on the army, thus starving
numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
other urgent demands, and an unsuccessful war naturally leads to the
conclusion that this expenditure has been thrown away. But, before
forming any judgment, it is necessary to be in possession of full
details of what had to be undertaken, and of the financial means
available. The problems which confronted our War Department were the
inevitable result of the policy pursued by it in former years; they
were, so to speak, the legacy of the nineteenth century to the
twentieth. That the size and cost of an army must be in direct
proportion to the growth of a nation and the military activity of its
neighbours, is a fact that cannot be ignored if we wish to rest assured
of the safety of our Empire. To us, in our comparatively immature state
of civilization, the burden of the armed peace necessitated by the
immense growth of armaments in Europe seems almost unbearable, and our
available funds are inadequate to meet all the initial and recurring
financial demands. It has only been possible to satisfy the most
urgent. To decide which were most important among such things as the
re-armament of the artillery, the construction of fortifications and
barracks, the accumulation of reserves, and the improvement of the
condition of the troops, etc., was a complicated and difficult enough
matter for the War Department; but the decision upon larger questions,
such as which frontiers were most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
in danger of attack or on which side our policy of expansion called for
another forward step, was beyond its scope. The solution was dependent
on the general political programme, and this was, in its turn, the
result of the policy followed in former centuries, and the outcome of
the internal condition and needs of the Empire.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1898, when I took over the duties of War Minister, I
found many schemes actually in progress, and numerous othersâworked out
and marked as urgentâfor the execution of which money had not been
available. Thanks to the ability and energy of my predecessor, the army
was in a high state of efficiency as compared with former years, and I
thus found myself in a favourable position to draw up a scheme of work
for the next quinquennium.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But, as has been explained,
the policy of my department was bound up with that of the Ministries of
the Interior, of Finance, and of Foreign Affairs, and there had been a
difference of opinion between the late War Minister and his colleagues
on some most important points. As there was no co-ordinated programme
between the War and Navy Departments, I was forced to spend my first
two years in office in framing an exhaustive statement for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
our guidance. In this I traced out and summarized the achievements of
Russian arms and what the tasks before them had been in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, showed which had been finished and which had
been left over for completion to the twentieth century, and pointed out
the sacrifices made by the nation towards this result. I reviewed the
condition of each of our frontiers, indicated the numbers and
organization that would be necessary for military operations in the
different probable theatres of war, and estimated the power of offence
of our most likely adversaries. Having thus arrived at some logical
conclusions as to what had to be faced in the coming century, it
remained to draw up definite proposals for the improvements necessary
in the organization for war of the army.</p>

<p>The General Staff Academy assisted me in my work, Colonel
Mishlaivski helping in the history, Major-General Zolotareff in the
military statistics, and Colonel Gulevitch in the administration.
Information on strategical matters was furnished by the General Staff.
This analysis was completed and submitted to the Tsar in the spring of
1900, and a few copiesâwith the secret strategic matter omittedâwere,
with his permission, sent to the Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs,
and the Interior, to the State Comptroller, and a few selected
officials. The programme for the period 1898â1902 was framed by me upon
the conclusions drawn from this statement. In 1903 a general report of
all that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
been carried out by my department during the previous five years was
printed and submitted to the Tsar. This document showed the funds
available, the total requirements which had been carried out, and those
left undone owing to the lack of money. Later on in the same year a
programme for the period 1904â1908 was submitted and approved. Thus,
for the twelve months immediately preceding hostilities work was
carried out according to a strictly defined programme, from the printed
record of which the results attained can be judged. In the same way
that we in the War Ministry were forced to have recourse to the lessons
of the past when framing our programme for the future, so in this work
is it necessary, in order to explain properly what was done in the
years 1898â1904, to refer to the conclusions upon which the programme
for this period was based.</p>

<p>My fourth and last volume consists of twelve<a name="FNanchor_8"
id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
chapters. In the first chapters I shall include some necessary extracts
from my analysis of 1900, and my report of 1903 upon the work of the
War Ministry for the quinquennium 1898â1902, omitting, of course,
confidential matter. The last chapters will be based on papers relating
to the recent war, on my diaries, and on articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
that appeared in the Press.</p>

<p>I have been so intimately connected with the important events in the
Far East, and have been so largely responsible for the failure of our
military operations, that I can hardly hope to take an entirely
dispassionate and objective view of the men and matters that I shall
deal with in the present work; but my object is not so much to justify
myself by replying to the charges that have been brought against me
personally, as to furnish material that will make it easier for the
future historian to state fairly the reasons for our defeat, and thus
enable us to avoid similar misfortunes in the future.</p>

THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND THE<br />JAPANESE WAR
</p>

<p class="subtitle2">
THE SUMMARY OF THE WAR
</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="capsub">An historical rÃ©sumÃ© of the problems which confronted
the Russian War Department during the past two
centuries.</p>


<p class="noindent">During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the
chief work accomplished by our armed forces was that necessitated by
the expansion of our Empire towards the north, west, and south, in her
struggle to reach the shores of the Baltic and Black Seas. During the
first years of the twentieth century our forces have been similarly
engaged in an approach towards the ocean, for, some years before the
recent war with Japanâbut after she had defeated Chinaâwe occupied
Manchuria and pushed forward our advanced troops into the Kuan-tung
Peninsula and on to the shores of the Pacific. During the war we had to
repel Japanâs advance while we maintained the position taken up by us
as far back as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
1897. In the event we have lost both Kuan-tung and Southern Manchuria,
and have been driven back in the Far East, with the result that we are
now in immediate contact on the mainland with Japan, who is in military
occupation of Korea, Kuan-tung, and Southern Manchuria. For Russia this
has been more than a surprise. It has been a disaster. But now that the
first outburst of natural grief has subsided, there is some possibility
of being able to trace the various causes to which our military
misfortunes are due, of drawing attention to the most important, and of
appreciating at their correct value the many hasty judgments pronounced
upon military events by the Press. The complexity of the chain of
circumstances which led up to hostilities, and the intricacy of the
military operations which followed, demand some detailed investigation
into the nature of the peculiar conditions which denied success to our
arms in Manchuria. A proper understanding of the difficulties will, I
think, be materially assisted by a review of certain events in our past
military history.</p>

<p>It was only after a severe struggle and a violent upheaval that
Russia became one united Empire in the seventeenth century. At the
commencement of the eighteenth there were, in our immense expanse of
territory amounting to some 265,000 square miles (of which 79,000 were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> in
Europe), only 12,000,000 inhabitants; and our frontiers, though only
partially defined, were already 9,333 miles in length. Our army was
about 150,000 to 200,000 strong, but was unreliable as a fighting force
owing to inferior organization and training. Of the total State
Budgetâsome Â£1,200,000âhalf was taken up for the maintenance of this
force. The proper defence of our long frontier necessitated an immense
army, for our boundaries were not strengthened by any natural features,
while our neighbours were powerful kingdoms, such as Sweden, Poland,
and Turkey, nomad Tartars, Caucasian mountaineers, and the Chinese,
about whom little was known.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, besides creating a regular army, we had
to carry on the following work, handed to us as a legacy from the
preceding hundred years:</p>

<p>In the north-west we had to continue the efforts of Tsars John III.
and IV. to drive Sweden from the Baltic littoral, and so push forward
our frontier to the coast-line.</p>

<p>In the west, to proceed with the work of Tsar Alexie-Michaelovitch,
and wrest White Russia and Little Russia from Poland.</p>

<p>In the south, to follow the course indicated by the Grand Dukes
Sviatosloff and Oleg, of advancing to the Black Sea coast and creating
unrest in Turkey, as a preparation for our further move forward.</p>

<p>In the south-east, to carry on the struggles of Tsar
Theodore-Ivanovitch and Boris Godunoff to convert the Caspian into a
Russian inland sea, and obtain a firm foothold on the ridge of the
Caucasus. In Asia, to extend the Empire in two directionsâtowards
Central Asia, for protection against raids, and towards Russiaâs
natural outlet in the East, the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>During this century it was only the first three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of these projects that we really set ourselves to
carry out. Our attempt in 1717 to gain possession
of Khiva ended in complete failure, which
for a long time arrested our advance in Central
Asia; while in Siberia, thanks to the peaceful
attitude of the Chinese and Japanese, and to the
weakness of the Kirghiz, we were enabled to
protect our 6,000-mile Chinese frontier with an
insignificant number of men. Of the three tasks
seriously attempted, the firstâthat of gaining
possession of the Baltic sea-boardâwas the most
difficult. For twenty-one years had that able
commander, Charles XII. of Sweden, fought
with a small but veteran army against the might
of Russia led by Peter the Great. Even the
genius of the latter did not avail to avert our
complete defeat at Narva in 1700, but his determined
efforts to create an army well trained and
numerically superior to the enemy were crowned
by our victory at Poltava just nine years later.
This struggleâthe Great Northern Warâonly
came to an end in 1721 with our annexation,
under the Treaty of Nishtabtski, of Ingermanland
(the province of St. Petersburg), Esthonia,
Livonia, and a small part of Finland, altogether
3,500 square miles. The reasons of our defeat
at Narva were that we put too few menâ50,000âin
the field in the first instance, and that they
were unreliable. During the course of the war
the army was increased in numbers to 136,000,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and at Poltava Peter the Great had a very large
superiority in numbers, besides the assistance of
experienced subordinates and veteran troops.
During the whole war we put in the field a total
of 1,700,000 men. Our access to the Baltic
cost us 120,000 killed and wounded, excluding
missing, and 500,000 invalided, but in gaining it
Russia won a place among the great Powers of
Europe. Our progress towards the Black Sea
proved almost as difficult, and necessitated four
wars with Turkey. In the firstâin 1711âwe
again committed the same initial error as we had
against Sweden, and started operations with insufficient
numbers, with the result that, in spite
of the presence of Peter the Great, we were
surrounded on the Pruth. Not only did we fail
in our object, but we were forced by the Turks
to surrender Azov, and to raze our fortifications on
the Lower Dnieper; but we brought up our total
numbers during the fourth war (1787 to 1791), by
gradual increases, to 700,000 men, and eventually
defeated the Turks. Our maximum number in
any one campaign was 220,000. By the Treaty of
Jassy<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we obtained the Crimea and the area between
the rivers Bug and Dniester. This final four
yearsâ struggle cost us 90,000 killed, wounded,
and missing, and about 300,000 invalided; the
total number of men put in the field during
the century in order to gain access to the Black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Sea being 1,500,000. The prosecution of the
third taskânamely, that of regaining Little
Russia and White Russiaâwas the cause of
three struggles with Poland, after the last of
which she ceased to be an independent State.
In these campaigns the largest army taking the
field on our side was 75,000 strong. The total
numbers on our side taking part in the three
wars were 400,000, our casualties being 30,000
killed, wounded, and missing, and 75,000 invalided.
It is plain, therefore, in which directions
our efforts at expansion during the
eighteenth century proved most costly. The
brunt of these struggles was borne by our army,
though our fleet, under Peter the Greatâits
founderâplayed a conspicuous and gallant part
in the conflict with Sweden.</p>

<p>The commencement of the nineteenth century
found Russia a strong Power as compared with
her condition a hundred years before. During
the past hundred years the Empire had extended
in area from 265,000 to 331,000 square
miles, and the population had increased to
37,000,000. The revenues had also grown considerably,
from Â£1,200,000 to Â£5,500,000; but the
finances of the State had been severely shaken
by incessant warfare. Though Â£2,200,000 had
been spent on military requirements, the whole
frontier was still in an unsettled state, and
required special watchfulness on account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
many politico-military questions which might
arise with Sweden, Prussia, Austria, the Caucasus,
and Central Asia.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The efforts which
had been made during the latter part of the
preceding century to develop our army had not
been fruitless. It had improved in quality and
in professional knowledge, had produced such
men as Rumantsieff and Suvoroff, and had
grown in numbers; but still its size was out of
all proportion to the countryâs financial position.
Economy was unknown in military affairs. The
administration was defective, there was no higher
tactical organization than the regiment, and the
training given was not uniform. The steps
taken by the Emperor Paul II. to rectify these
defects were without success, and the war establishment
was reduced from 500,000 to 400,000.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Theoretically, the army was distributed over
twelve inspection areas or military districts; but
when the western districts became incorporated
in the Empire, and we thereby became directly
involved in the political problems of Europe,
the greater portion of our troops was required
to garrison the country west of the Dnieper.
In 1799 about 100,000 men were stationed
across the frontier,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> approximately 130,000
formed two armies in the south-western districts,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and in the north some 50,000 were
distributed around the capital; the rest were scattered
throughout the country, about 25,000 being
on the Siberian and Caucasian frontiers. Though
a continuation of what had gone before, the
military problems of the nineteenth century had
to be faced under more complicated conditions.
In the north-west Russia had still to put the
finishing touch to her effort towards an outlet
on the Baltic by gaining possession of the
northern shores of the Gulf of Finland and the
eastern shores of the Gulf of Bothnia. In
the west the Poles had to be kept in subjection,
and our frontier defended from Prussia and
Austria. We had to maintain the position we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
had won, and also to oppose Napoleonâs army
of a million men. In the south we had to
make permanent our footing on the shores of
the Black Sea, and to guard its coasts from
oversea attack. In the Caucasus and the Far
East everything remained to be done. The consolidation
of our position in the two latter
directions, so as to protect, before all else, the
Russian population of the southern districts,
demanded an energetic advance.</p>

<p>It was upon the army that a large share of
the execution of these projects naturally fell.
Firstly, the beginning of the century was remarkable
for our colossal struggle with France,
of which Suvoroffâs campaign in 1799 was the
commencement. We advanced against Napoleon
as the ally of Austria and Germany, whom he
was in the process of destroying; but the campaigns
ended in our utter defeat at Austerlitz
in 1805, and Friedland in 1807. The war in
our country of 1812â14 was a continuation of
the first two Napoleonic wars, and, notwithstanding
the invasion of Russia by an immense
army, and the fact that our troops were driven
back beyond Moscow, Napoleon was defeated,
Europe was freed from his yoke, and Poland
became an integral portion of the Russian Empire.
The determination with which Peter the Great
and Alexander I. conducted their struggles
against such opponents as Charles XII. and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Napoleon is in the highest degree instructive.
In both cases we commenced hostilities with
inadequate numbers, suffered complete initial
defeat at Narva, Austerlitz, and Friedland, but
nevertheless continued the contest. In both
cases our troops were reinforced, and gradually
became trained and seasoned; leaders were
created by the war itself, and our numbers
increased until we obtained superiority over the
enemy, and finally ended the struggle victoriously
by winning the battle of Poltava in the one
case, and by marching into Paris in the other.</p>

<p>One result of these wars was the final definition
of our present boundary with Poland, which
will soon have been established for one hundred
years. Any alteration of it, as will be shown
later, would not only be distinctly detrimental
to our interests, but could only be brought
about by a European conflict, which would entail
such appalling sacrifices that any change would
be on the whole as disadvantageous to Germany
and Austria as to Russia. Thus we can at once
dismiss the defence of our present Polish frontier
from the probable tasks of the twentieth century.
Still, the Poles, split up as they are amongst
three great Powers, with their well-known
national aspirations, have not up till now become
reconciled to their fate, and the internal pacification
and administration of Poland will doubtless
prove one of the problems of this century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Though our most difficult piece of work in
the eighteenth century had been the attempt
to gain an outlet on the Baltic, the completion
of this task in the nineteenth met with little
opposition from Norway and Sweden. The
campaign with the latter country in 1808â09
lasted fifteen months, and ended with our
annexation of Finland. During its progress the
army was never stronger than 44,000 men, the
total number put into the field amounting
to 65,000. Our casualties were 7,000 killed,
wounded, and missing, and 9,000 invalided;
total, 16,000. It is interesting to note that we
were in superior strength in forty-three engagements,
of which we won twenty-nine and lost
fourteen. Although after this war we annexed
Finland as an integral part of our Empire, we
paid too little attention to its internal affairs,
the result being that there grew up close to our
capital a large hostile country, of which the
population, though small in number, was stubborn
and independent in character, and was
imbued with ideals entirely differing from our
own. The final incorporation of Finland in the
Empire has been left for our statesmen of the
present century.</p>

<p>The consolidation of our position on the Black
Sea, which we had gained in 1791, was proceeded

spite of three wars waged with Turkeyâin

1806â12, 1828â29, 1877â78. The first ended in
our annexation of a portion of Bessarabia. By
the second we acquired the mouths of the Danube
and a strip of the Black Sea littoral, 370 miles
long. The interference of the European Powers
in Russian affairs, in order to weaken us in the
Near East, led to the Crimean War of 1854â56,
which resulted unfortunately for us, as we lost
our Black Sea fleet and the possession of the
mouths of the Danube. At the time of the
Crimean War we had a numerically strong army,
and much excellent material both among the
officers and the rank and file. A great number
of the former were of the nobility; the men were
long-service soldiers (twenty-five years); while
the warrant and non-commissioned officers were
experienced men, and wielded considerable authority.
But after the successful wars we had waged
earlier in the century the army had deteriorated
in war-training and fallen behind in armament.
All ranks had been deeply bitten by Arakcheeffâs
views of military science, the senior ranks being
specially weak. That an army was intended for
war was quite forgotten. Spit and polish and
parade smartness were considered far more than
battle efficiency, and more attention was paid to
the âmanual exerciseâ and to ceremonial movements
than to anything else. The best proof of
the views held at this period was the way in
which commanding officers of all arms permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the rifles to be filed and burnished, so that, in
performing rifle exercises, a thousand rifles would
flash and ring together as smartly as one. An
officerâs military career depended on the interest
behind him. Without influence only those got
on who most slavishly performed the wishes of
their commanders, however cruel or barbarous.
The national movement towards greater personal
freedom, initiated by Emperor Alexander I. after
the Napoleonic wars, had penetrated to the rank
and file of the army, but had now been replaced
by an Administration which paralyzed every
activity or impulse towards initiative throughout
the country, and acted like a blight on every
grade of the population, civil as well as military.
Everyone was, so to speak, dressed in a tunic
buttoned right up to the chin, and looked as if he
had âswallowed a poker.â The whole country,
army included, could say nothing but âVery
good,â âQuite so,â and âAll correct.â The
private soldier was treated with cruelty, and was
badly fed; peculation and dishonesty of all kinds
were rampant. Not only did commanding officers
largely augment their pay from the money granted
for the purchase of forage, but this was winked
at as being only natural. As had always been
the system, the commands of regiments were
given to the younger sons of the nobility, to
enable them to exist, while the favouritism shown
to the Guards was the curse of the service. Any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
display of initiative by soldiers was punished,
and the Press was afraid to speak; a discussion
in a military paper of questions of dress even
was considered to be harmful âfree-thinking.â
The result was that while we were outdistanced
in <i>matÃ©riel</i> by the armies of Europe, we made no
progress in <i>moral</i>, despite our large numbers.
Holding such views as, for instance, that the
main use of a rifle was to make a pleasant noise
in the âmanual exercise,â we naturally did not
worry about re-armament, and entered upon the
war of 1854â56 armed with smooth-bore weapons
against our opponentsâ rifles. The spirit of our
fleet, fresh from its victory at Sinope, and having
such men in command as Lazareff, Nakhimoff,
Korniloff, and Istomin, was excellent, and its
numbers were strong; but, technically, it was
even more behind the other fleets of Europe
than our army was behind the land forces of our
neighbours, and against our sailing-ships in the
Black Sea the Allies brought a fleet of steam-vessels.
The peace strength of the standing
army in 1850â60 was more than 1,100,000 men,
but the greater part of it was stationed in the
western frontier districts, in the Caucasus, and in
the large cities. The peace strength of the Allied
armies amounted to: France, 400,000; Great
Britain, 140,000; Turkey, 450,000. Only a portion
of these forces took part in the war, but
nevertheless Russia was beaten.</p>

<p>As regards our preparedness in our first campaign
on the Danube, an officer who took part
writes in his recently published Memoirs:<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe conflict with the West in the Crimean
War of 1854â56 ought not to have taken us by
surprise. Rumours of war were prevalent in
the summer of 1852; and, on account of these
rumours, particular anxiety was felt concerning
the inefficiency of our transport and military
equipment generally. Indeed, the late Emperor
Nicolai-Pavlovitch, at his autumn inspection at
Elisavetgrad, personally warned the troops of the
proximity of hostilities. Finally, in June, 1853,
our troops crossed the Pruth and occupied the
Danube Principality, and in October Turkey
declared war. Our brilliant victory and the total
destruction of the enemyâs fleet at Sinope aroused
the enthusiasm of the whole nation, but gave
France and great Britain a <i>casus belli</i> against
us. Then began the long series of sad and
scandalous disasters to the Russian arms. The
Danube campaign of 1853â54 could not possibly
have been successful, for it was carried out with
no definite object. Either because we did not
fathom Austriaâs real intentions, or else believed
that she would remain neutral, we tried to meet
her demands, and by so doing tied our own hands.
Our defence of the left bank of the river was not
favoured by one single piece of good fortune, and
our offensive operations were soon abandoned
under pressure from Austria. The campaign
brought us neither honour nor gain, and while
once more confirming the gallantry of the Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
soldier, it exposed the criminal incapacity of
his commanders and the many abuses which
had crept into the Service. In June, 1854, we
returned with shame and anger to our own
country from the walls of undefeated Silistria,
and the Allies turned their glances towards the
Crimea.â</p></div>

<p>The disembarkation of the allied armies, only
50,000 strong, seemed madness in face of our force
of 1,000,000 men and our strong fleet. However,
Prince Menshikoff, the Commander-in-Chief,
and a professional sailor into the bargain, allowed
the landing to take place without hindrance at
Eupatoria on September 14 and 15, though he
had at his disposal sixty vessels, amongst them
some steamers. Though the fleet could not, of
course, have counted with absolute certainty on
victory, we had it in our power then to wreck
the enemyâs plan of operations by dispersing their
convoys of transports. The Allies were on the
sea from September 8 to September 14 between
Varna and Eupatoria, but we were unable to find
them. At the Alma we had 33,000 men (42
battalions, 16 squadrons, 84 guns), and offered
a determined resistance; but though we were
operating in our own country, we did not
know the locality, and General Boskey, leading
his column by a path of whose existence we
were ignorant, fell upon our left flank. This
attack decided the day, and our troops were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
routed.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Then on September 26 began the
eleven monthsâ struggle for Sevastopol. Our
exhausted fleet landed a number of guns and
lent some experienced commanders to the armyâchief
of all, Nakhimoff, Korniloff, and Istomin.
Operations now assumed the character of siege
warfare, in which our troops played their part
most nobly; but it must be remembered that the
army of the Crimea was twice severely beaten:
on November 5, 1854, at Inkerman, and on
August 17, 1855, at the Tchernaya. Regarding
the Battle of Inkerman, the above-quoted writer
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âPrince Menshikoff, with the arrival of the
remaining two divisions of the 4th &nbsp;Infantry
Corps, had, in addition to the Sevastopol garrison,
an army of 40,000 men under him, but he lost the
great battle of Inkerman on November&nbsp;5, 1854.
Its object was to seize Sapun Ridge, as a first step
to raising the siege of the town, after which he
would have driven the Allies towards Balaclava
and then out of the Crimea. The battle was
well planned, every arrangement was made to
insure victory, but the result was, owing to the
incomprehensible mistakes of individual commanders,
a bloody and decisive defeat.</p>

<p class="tbreak">* * * * *</p>

<p>âTen thousand casualties, a loss of <i>moral</i>
among the troopsâthe soldiersâ lack of confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in their leaders, as well as Prince Menshikoffâs
distrust of the army under his commandâwere
the results of this disaster which for so long
doomed our force to play a passive rÃ´le. The
ultimate issue of the Crimean campaign was
really settled by this; the moment for the relief
of Sevastopol had been missed, and our field
operations lost every trace of initiative. A moral
deterioration set in which led to unheard-of
irregularities in our army.â</p></div>

<p>Menshikoff was replaced by Prince Gorchakoff,
but things became no better. The troops at the
Alma<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> were commanded just as they had been
at Inkerman. While individual commanders
did not help one another, the attack delivered
from Sevastopol did not support the operations
on the Alma. On September 8 the Allies delivered
an assault, and seized Malakhoff Hill.
Though they were driven back with great loss
from other portions of the position, we were
compelled to withdraw from the northern side
during the night of the 10th. This retirement
was decisive, and peace was declaredâa peace
dishonourable to us, for by it we were deprived
of the right to maintain a fleet on the Black Sea,
and lost the mouths of the Danube. This result
was all the more painful as the Allies were
inferior to us in strength, and, had we been
determined to continue the war at all costs,
would have been obliged to make up their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
minds to conquer the Peninsula. Even had
they succeeded in taking it, we ought, remembering
Peter the Greatâs counsel in the
Northern War, and Alexander I.âs example in
the war of the Fatherland, to have continued
the struggle.</p>

<p>Our weak points were the incapacity of our
seniors and of our staff, and particularly the
inefficiency of the supply services. Of the
different arms, the infantry, artillery, and sappers
were the most reliable, while the cavalry, despite
its numbers, played a small and inglorious part.
It was very difficult to maintain communication
with our own country in the rear, especially in
the winter, when the roads were bad. The
transport of supplies to the front encountered
such great obstacles, and was so badly arranged,
that the troops had not only to undergo great
hardships, but were often in actual want of food.
The medical services also were shockingly
organized. Drunkenness and gambling amongst
both officers and men, especially at a distance
from the advanced positions, were of everyday
occurrence, and looting and robbery of every
kind became universal. But this was the seamy
side of affairs, and did not imply that the whole
army or the whole nation were rotten, for,
despite all the mistakes of our commanders, the
men kept up their spirit, and were quite ready to
fight on until victory should eventually crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
their efforts. The war produced Nakhimoff,
Korniloff, and Istomin, who met heroic deaths,
whilst amongst the survivors stood out the names
of Khruleff, Todleben, Sabashinski, and others.
Of the regimental commanders, most proved in
every way fitted for their duties, and many
junior officers of all arms became seasoned
veterans whom the private soldiers would follow
anywhere. The men were patient, enduring,
brave, and ignorant.</p>

<p>The finances of the country, moreover, were
not crippled by this war. Throughout the
operations only two loans were raised, amounting
to Â£10,000,000; Â£43,000,000 of paper-money
were issued, and Â£19,000,000 taken in State
banks. Altogether the war cost us Â£72,000,000.
Even in 1856 general belief in our power and
resources was not shaken, and our credit stood
high, in spite of our disasters in the field. We,
therefore, could and ought to have continued
the struggle. If we had done so, the Allies
would, as I have said, have been obliged to
undertake the conquest of the Crimea. In proportion
as they advanced from the coast their
difficulties would have increased, while our army,
gaining numbers and experience, would have
become more and more formidable, and would in
the end have hurled them back into the sea.
In his notes on the war our historian, Solovieff
wrote as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âAt the time of the accession of the new
Emperor, the minds of all were full of the
painful ending of the Crimean War. Alexander
II. was forced to begin his reign with the
conclusion of a peace such as no Russian Emperor
had accepted since the peace after the Pruth,
and the new Emperor felt to the full the weight
of the burden imposed upon him. Foreign
affairs were by no means in so critical a state
that an energetic ruler could not have emerged
from the war without loss of dignity or material
advantages. In the interior of Russia there was
no exhaustion; the nation was by no means
driven to extremities. The new Tsar, whom
everyone desired to love, could undoubtedly, if
he had appealed to this feeling and to the national
patriotism, have aroused a tremendous enthusiasm
which would have supported any action he chose
to take. The Allies not only felt the burden of
the war, but were desperately anxious for its
close, and a firm announcement by the Tsar to
the effect that he intended to continue fighting
until an honourable peace was concluded would
undoubtedly have compelled them to fall back.</p>

<p class="tbreak">* * * * *</p>

<p>â... But for this course of action, breadth of
view, daring, capability, and energy were necessaryâqualities
which the new Emperor did not
possess. It would even have been sufficient if
he had had round him advisers who would have
lent him some support, but there was not a man
of any moral or intellectual strength in his
entourage. He was surrounded by those who,
haunted by the groundless fear of having to fight
the whole of Europe, had been partly responsible
for Nicholasâs retreat. The only voices to be
heard now were those that cried: âPeace! peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
at any price!â And so, after the fall of Sevastopol,
peace was concluded at a moment when
that place might have played the same rÃ´le as
Moscow did in 1812. After the sacrifice of the
fortress we should have announced that, far from
being over, operations were only just beginning!
With the Allies would have then remained the
onus of finishing the war.â</p></div>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the results of the campaign
was universal, and penetrated all grades of
society. The root of the evil was seen to lie in
our serfdom, so the Tsar Alexander II., the
most humane of men, himself headed a movement
for the emancipation of the serfs. They received
their freedom. This event was of extraordinary
importance, constituting, in truth, an epoch in
Russian life, which affected all spheres of activity,
not excluding that of the War Department. A
new language was heard on all sides. Indeed, it is
difficult now to realize the animated, convincing,
and liberal tone of the articles which appeared in
the <i>Voenni Sbornik</i>. But, alas! everything soon
returned to its former state. The Polish rebellion
of 1863, the attempt to assassinate the Tsar, and
the open conspiracies of a few evil-minded people,
served as a pretext for the adherents of the old
rÃ©gime to strive for the reduction of the rights
that had been granted. Their efforts were
crowned with success, and a reaction set in which
was particularly violent as regards educational
and agrarian affairs. The War Department,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
however, was under the enlightened guidance of
General Milutin, who, as far as possible, reduced
the effect of this reaction upon the army; the
department, indeed, was on this account for
some time looked upon with suspicion. Though
the Crimean War did arouse to some extent the
latent patriotism of the masses, it was waged at
too great a distance from the heart of the people
to have earned the title of a national struggle.</p>

<p>It is unthinkable that any great nation could
ever have become reconciled to the terms of
such a peace as that signed by Russia in 1856,
when she engaged to abstain from maintaining
a fleet in the Black Sea, and to give up the
mouths of the Danube, won by her in 1828â29.
However involved, therefore, its causes may
appear, the war of 1877â78 was in reality but
a continuation of our two-hundred-year-old
struggle towards the Black Sea, on this occasion
complicated by the necessity of assisting our
kindred in the Balkansâthe Servians and Bulgarians.
Though we did not make the most
of our opportunities, the time for preparation
allowed us by the Turko-Servian War really
decided the issue of that between ourselves and
Turkey. It is true we mobilized and concentrated
the army in Bessarabia before the declaration
of war, but we delayed so long in
making this declaration that the Turks also had
time for preparation. The severe reverses we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
suffered after our initial successes showed that
our opponents, who were now armed with the
breech-loading rifle and organized on the European
model, were no longer the foe that we had
faced in 1828, whose mobs of armed men were
easily routed by small bodies of our troops. As
usual, we put too few men in the field at first;
but the Emperor, upon the advice of General
Milutin, pressed masses of reinforcements to
the front, among them the Guards and the
Grenadiers, the flower of our army. Our comparatively
short line of communication enabled
this to be done with considerable rapidity. It
was at Plevna, in August, 1877, that we suffered
our last heavy reverse, and by October the
Guards and Grenadiers had arrived at the front.
Including the Roumanian, Servian, Montenegrin,
and Bulgarian militias, we succeeded in
placing superior numbers in the field, our armies
amounting altogether to some 850,000 men in
both theatres of operations, and in spite of the
enemyâs gallant opposition, we advanced up to
the very walls of their capital. But it was not
a lightly-won victory. To break down the
stubborn defence of the Turks, who were ably
commanded at Plevna, we were forced to put
thrice their number into the field. Dubniak
Hill, which was very weakly fortified, was only
taken by the Guards, who were five or six times
as strong as the enemy at that particular point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
after a desperate fight. Though their earth-works
were mostly of field profile, and without
any obstacles, such as wire entanglement, mines,
and abatis; though the defenders had no bomb-proof
shelters; and though we were three to one
in men, and put many more guns in action, we
were unable to seize Plevna by assault, but had
to resort to a blockade. Our Commander-in-Chief,
however, was ably supported on the
European side by such distinguished leaders as
Gurko, Skobeleff, Radetski, and Todleben,
whose troops soon became seasoned, and brought
victory to our arms. In the theatre of operations
in Asia the Grand-Duke Michael Nicolaeff was
assisted by Lazareff, Heyman, Ter-Gukasoffâall
energetic and able soldiers. Under them our
Caucasian force did gallant service. While the
force under Kridner and Zotovi was being
driven back from the weak Plevna position,
they were engaged in night assaults on the
fortress of Kars. The defence of the Shipka
Pass and of Bayazet, on the Turkish side, are
among the most brilliant achievements in our
military history.</p>

<p>This war again showed up many blots in our
organization. The supply and medical services
were very inefficient. The work of the cavalry
and artillery on the European side was not up
to expectation. The whole burden of the campaign
was borne by the infantry, and right well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
did this Arm issue from the ordeal. In some
engagements units lost as much as one-third or
even half their strength, and yet were able to
re-form and continue the action. Nor was there
anything to complain of as regards the reservists.
Their long halt at Kishineff enabled them to
shake down and to amalgamate with the serving
soldiers. Certain units, however, just brought
up to strength with reservists, and sent into
action before they had had time to be properly
trained and disciplined, were not on every occasion
as steady as they should have been; but, generally
speaking, our troops upheld their reputation
for gallantry, steadiness, endurance, and discipline.
But we were stronger in defence than
in the attack. Although this campaignâour
first experience after the introduction of the law
of universal military serviceâended successfully,
it emphasized the inferiority of our arrangements
for rapid mobilization and concentration as compared
with those of our western neighbours.
The men were called up upon no regular
mobilization scheme or system, and the reserve
units were formed haphazard, and, owing to the
inefficiency of the railways running to Roumania,
the general concentration was slow. Our information
about the enemy was insufficient and
unreliableâit was due to our ignorance of
their strength that we took the field with such
weak numbers. Our re-armament was not completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
owing to lack of funds, and we started
operations with three different patterns of rifle.
We did not have enough maps, and the reconnaissance
sketches which had been madeâof the
Shipka position, for instanceâwere left behind
in St. Petersburg. Our artillery <i>matÃ©riel</i> was
technically inferior to the enemyâs, our 4-pounder
gun in particular being useless. The engineer
services and stores were insufficient, and their
distribution was bad. Thus, in the fights at
Plevna on September 12 and 13, when Skobeleff
and Imeretinski led the main attack on the
enemyâs fortified position, with an army corps
consisting of twenty-two battalions, there was
only a detachment of some thirty sappers, which
I myself had by chance been able to collect!
Siege material was not forthcoming in sufficient
quantity, and what there was was of obsolete
pattern. I have touched upon the cavalry duties
on the European side, which were, with few
exceptions, unsatisfactorily and selfishly performed
throughout the war. The work of the
artillery, which on the Caucasian side was
splendid and self-sacrificing, in Europe often
left much to be desired. There were instances
of batteries retiring because a few men had been
wounded. Many of the most senior commanders
were unfit for their positions, and capable artillery
or cavalry leaders were few and far between.
The staff work, particularly that of the General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Staff, was seldom good. There was far too
much correspondence before a battle, while to
report the most important events, or to inform
subordinates of what was happening, was a duty
frequently forgotten in the stress of action.
During the actual combat touch was not properly
maintained either laterally or to the rear,
and as a result there was little co-operation
between the different arms, the brunt of the
fight being thrown almost entirely on the
infantry. The light railway communication
(via Roumania) was inadequate in capacity and
badly organized. There were no rest-camps
along the line, and in winter, when the roads
were cut up, the transport of every kind of
supplies was almost impossible. The attitude of
our troops in Bulgaria towards the inhabitants
was not always humane or just. Payment for
produce brought in was made irregularly, or not
at all, owing to the improper system whereby
forage allowance was treated as the perquisite of
a commanding officer. Away from the front
disorder and debauchery were common. Owing
to our hurried advance in insufficient strength,
we were obliged to evacuate areas of the country
once occupied, and the people who had at first
received us with open arms as liberators were
forced either to retire with us or be slain by the
returning Turks. Consequently, for a time there
was a general revulsion of feeling; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Bulgarians lost all faith in us, and began to turn
towards the enemy. Up to a certain point it
was the Crimea over again. Strong in defence,
we were weak in power of manÅuvre, and our
attacks consequently suffered from clumsiness:
this was notably the case at Plevna. On the
other hand, there is no doubt that we were
greatly assisted by the comparative unreadiness
of the Turks for any offensive operations; otherwise
our cordon in Bulgaria might have easily
been broken in August or September, before
reinforcements reached us. We should then
have been obliged to fall back behind the
Danube. Only the jealousy and incompetence
of the Turkish leaders, and the interference from
Constantinople, saved us from misfortune. In
spite, however, of all our want of organization,
in spite of all our shortcomings, we defeated the
Turks, capturing whole army corps at Plevna,
Shipka, and Kars, and finally marched victoriously
to the walls of Constantinople itself.
This was the last great war in which we were
engaged in the nineteenth century, and immediately
after it, in 1879, our military self-esteem
received a severe blow in Central Asia. Repeated
raiding by the Turcomans, carried out
even in the neighbourhood of Krasnovodsk,
necessitated a special expedition into the Turcoman
Steppe. The experienced and veteran
leader, General Lazareff, was appointed to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
command, but at his death, on the eve of the
departure of the force from the line of the Artek
towards Geok Tepe, the command unfortunately
passed to the next seniorâGeneral Lomakinâwho
was quite unfitted for such responsibility.
The expedition ended in disaster. The force
reached Geok Tepe, the weakly fortified Turcoman
stronghold, and made an attempt to storm
it which was unsuccessful, though our troops
consisted of the magnificent Caucasian regiments.
We were forced to abandon several hundred
breech-loading rifles, and to retire with great loss
to the fortified posts on the line of the Artek. We
had to make greater efforts, and had to organize
quite a large forceâmeasured by the standard of
Asiatic warfare. General Skobeleff, an especially
able and energetic man, was given the
command of it, and after a severe fight he defeated
the Turcomans and seized Geok Tepe.
We twice met with reverses in the different night
attacks made by the enemy, being overwhelmed
by sheer numbers after desperate hand-to-hand
fighting; we lost three guns and the standard of
one of the most distinguished of our Caucasian
regiments.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But Skobeleff succeeded in instilling
into the minds of all that, whatever the loss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or sufferings, they should continue to fight to the
bitter end. So we won. This expedition showed,
however, that the time had passed when columns
composed of a few companies, like those under
the command of Generals Cherniaeff and Kaufmann,
could defeat greatly superior numbers of
natives. Besides being very brave, the Turcomans
were armed with captured Berdan rifles,
with which they managed to inflict severe loss
upon us. Of the small force of under 5,000
which attacked Geok Tepe, we lost about 1,000
in killed and wounded. The very last action in
which our troops took part in the nineteenth
century was the affair at Kushk in 1885,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> when
a small Russian force defeated the Afghans at
the expense of forty-three men.</p>

<p>The result of the Turkish War of 1877â78 was
that we regained the mouths of the Danube, and
obtained possession of Batoum and Kars. In
our contests with Turkey in the nineteenth century
our primary object was the freeing of the
various Balkan nationalities still subject to
Turkey. But this question touched too closely
the interests of the other nations of Europe, who
opposed us, by force at Sevastopol, and diplomatically
at the Berlin Congress. The lack of
simplicity in our aims also militated against our
success, for in our anxiety over the fate of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
minor nationalities we lost sight of our own
material interests. Consequently, the results
attained in this century on the Black Sea did not
on the whole correspond to the sacrifices we
made. In the three wars with Turkey we put
1,700,000 men into the field (bringing the strength
of the army up to 850,000 men in 1878), and
lost in killed, wounded, and missing 126,000;
sick, 243,000; a total of 369,000. If we take
into account that we put 1,300,000 men into the
field during the Crimean War, and that our
casualties in killed, wounded, and missing were
120,000, and in sick 220,000, it appears that the
acquisition of the Black Sea littoral, the mouths
of the Danube, and the right to maintain a war
fleet on the Black Sea, cost us 3,000,000 men put
into the field, a loss in battle of 250,000, and
460,000 invalided. Yet, in spite of all these
sacrifices, the gateway out of the Black Sea
remained closed to us and open to our possible
foes. In 1878 we were virtually in possession of
this gateway, but now it is guarded against us
not only by the Turks, but by the Germans. The
task of preserving our position on the Mediterranean
from the Black Sea has passed to the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>To obtain possession of the Caucasus we had
to fight twice with Persia in the nineteenth
century, and were at war for sixty-two years
with the mountaineers of the Caucasus. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
arriving at our present frontier in Central Asia
we had been making expeditions for thirty years.
Our operations both in the Caucasus and in
Central Asia were productive of many gallant
feats. Though in the former we crossed swords
with a particularly brave opponent, and had to
contend against extraordinary natural difficulties,
we were in greatly superior numbers and far
better organized than the enemy, and from a
purely military point of view the contest did not
present at all the same difficulties as the wars
against the Turks. During our operations in
Central Asia, from 1847 to 1881, we never had
more than 15,000 men in the field at one time.
The total number sent out was some 55,000, of
whom we did not lose as many as 5,000 killed
and wounded, and 8,000 sick. Our work in
these two directions can be said to have been
completed in the nineteenth century, for, as will
be shown later, not only is no realignment of our
present frontier necessary, but no change is possible
without risking serious conflicts with Turkey,
Persia, Afghanistan, and, probably, Great Britain.
But the character of the Caucasian and Central
Asian peoples will demand constant watchfulness
and a strong hand in order to prevent racial and
religious risings.</p>

<p>In spite of the small force maintained in
Siberia, we considerably altered our frontier line
in the east during the nineteenth century, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the twentieth century we must be careful to
preserve the peaceful relations which have lasted
for 200 years between the Chinese and ourselves.</p>

<p>During that period we lost our possessions in
America by making them over to the United
States for a small sum of money. We also practically
forced the Japanese to give us the southern
portion of Saghalien in exchange for the Island
of Kurile, and annexed Kamchatka, the Amur
and Ussuri districts, and finally the Kuan-tung
Peninsula. The Ussuri district was awarded to
us by the Peking Treaty of 1860, more or less as
a reward for the assistance we gave China in the
drafting of the Peking Treaty with the French
and British after their capture of Peking. Similarly,
our movement in Manchuria was, so to
speak, a <i>quid pro quo</i> for our mediation and
intercession on Chinaâs behalf after her unsuccessful
war with Japan. Thus, while our advance
to the Baltic and Black Seas cost two
centuries of work by the army and many lives,
we were able to reach the Pacific seaboard in
1897 without any bloodshed. But the success
so easily gained was pregnant with the seeds of
disaster.</p>

<p>During the last two centuries the expansion of
the Empire implied a gradual realignment of all
our frontiers, except on the greater part of that
between us and China, which, from the valley of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the Katuna to the mouth of the Schilka, remained
unchanged for 200 years. The western frontier
had moved from a distance of 300 miles from
Moscow in 1700 to one of 670 miles. In the
north-west and south we had reached natural
boundaries in the Baltic and Black Seas.
In the same period we had pushed forward our
confines a considerable distance from the
Caucasus and in Central Asia. The following
figures show us roughly what the two main
struggles, between the years 1700 and 1900, have
cost us in men: In our efforts to reach the Black
Sea we lost 750,000 out of 3,200,000<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> men put in
the field against Turkey, while the conflict with
Sweden for an approach to the Baltic cost us
700,000 out of the 1,800,000 combatants employed.
This is sufficient to convey some idea
of what sacrifices we must expect from our army
in any attempt on our part to reach the shores
of the Pacific and Indian Oceans during the
present century. Moreover, the growth of our
territory has forced us to include within it many
and different foreign and even hostile races, and
our frontier is to-day (1900),<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> from a military
point of view, therefore less soundly established
than it was in 1700. Though the population of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the Empire has increased from 12,000,000 to
130,000,000, it must be remembered that we
have now on and within our borders more than
40,000,000 who are only partly connected to us
by racial ties, but are more or less alien both by
religion and by their historical past.</p>

<p>Within the same period peace reigned in Russia
for 71<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> years.
During the remaining 128<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> years
there were thirty-three foreign and two internal
wars, which can be classified, according to the
political objects for which they were fought, in
the following order:</p>

<p>1. For the expansion of the Empireâtwenty-two
wars, lasting about 101 years.</p>

<p>2. In defence of the Empireâfour wars,
lasting 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> years.</p>

<p>3. In the interests of general European politicsâseven
wars and two campaigns, taking
10 years.</p>

<p>4. Civil warsâtwo wars, lasting 65 years.</p>

<p>5. For the suppression of revoltsâ6 years of
military operations.</p>

<p>These conflicts exposed to the horrors of war
some 10,000,000 of people, of whom about one-third
were lost to the nation, nearly 1,000,000
being killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The gradual change in the war establishment
of the army (excluding militia, second line
troops, and reserve) can be traced from the
following figures:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1700, with a population of 12,000,000, we
had a war strength of 56,000 menâ<i>i.e.</i>, 0Â·47 per
cent. of the population. In 1800, with a population
of 35,000,000, we had a war strength of 400,000â<i>i.e.</i>,
1Â·14 per cent. In 1900, with a population
of 132,000,000, we had 1,000,000â<i>i.e.</i>, 0Â·75 per
cent. It must, however, be noted that the army
had only just been formed in 1700, and that
very shortly afterwards its war strength rose to
150,000â<i>i.e.</i>, 1Â·3 per cent. Thus, notwithstanding
the introduction of a new system of recruiting
our forces (the law of universal military
service), and their gradual growth, the proportionate
burden imposed upon the nation in keeping
the ranks filled was at the beginning of the
twentieth century about one-half of what it had
been 100 and 200 years before. This is all the
more remarkable, as in 1700 and 1710 the army
had not been properly developed, and was considerably
below its strength in 1800, owing to
the reforms of the Emperor Paul Petrovitch.
The great difference between the peace and war
establishments first arose in 1855, on account
of the Crimean War, but it became permanent
upon the introduction of universal military
service.</p>

<p>As regards the work that would probably fall
to the Russian armed forces in the twentieth
century, I wrote the following in a report I made,
as War Minister in 1901:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âWith the limitations of human understanding,
it is not possible to look ahead a hundred
years, and we cannot, therefore, lay down what
our army will have to undertake in the twentieth
century; but by analyzing the past and reviewing
our present position among the great Powers
of the world, it is both possible and essential
to estimate the nature of the work that will
come before our army in the next few years at
least. In the last two centuries Russiaâs main
work was connected with the expansion of the
Empire. <i>From this it seems that the matter of
our frontiers is still the most urgent.</i> It is,
therefore, important to answer the following
vital questions: Are we content with our present
frontier? If not, where and why are we not?
This is a matter which must not be considered
only from our own point of view. If we are
content with our position, and are not anxious to
advance or retire our frontier, it is certainly improbable
that we shall undertake any wars of
aggression in the twentieth century; but in
arriving, by great efforts and the immense sacrifices
of 200 years, at a position satisfactory to
ourselves, we have, perhaps, so placed our neighbours
that it may be their object in the coming
century to regain the territory of which they
have been deprived. If so, the danger of war
will not have been removed; it will have been
changed in nature from that of an offensive to a
defensive struggle.â</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="capsub">Russiaâs frontiers in Europe and AsiaâConclusions as to
their suitability to the needs of the Empire.</p>

<p class="noindent">The second chapter of a report, made in 1900, when
I was Minister for War, contained a strategical review of our
frontiers. The general conclusions arrived at may be summarized as
follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Swedish Frontier.</i><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>âThis is 1,000 miles
long, and traverses a rugged, inaccessible, and
sparsely populated country. Starting from the
extreme northern point of the Gulf of Bothnia,
and running due north, it acts as a sharply
defined ethnographical line between the Scandinavians
on the west and the Finns on the
east. The southern portion quite corresponds
to our requirements, but the northern is too
artificially drawn, and is disadvantageous to us,
as it cuts Finland off from the Arctic Ocean,
and gives all the coast to Norway. We would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
naturally like to see a realignment of this portion,
but the advantages to be gained are too insignificant
to warrant our quarrelling about them.
Still, the situation on this section of our border
cannot be considered to be all that is to be
desired.</p>

<p>It has been shown in the preceding chapter
what efforts and sacrifices have been made by
Russia in order to gain access to the Baltic Sea
and the Gulfs of Finland and Bothnia. We had
to fight four wars with Sweden, and put
1,800,000 men into the field, and only won at
last after losing some 130,000 men in killed and
wounded. The main factor in our success was
the influence on events exercised by Peter the
Great, for it was his victory at Poltava which
opened the way for us. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century the Viborg province was, to
a certain extent, Russianized: Russian villages
and churches were to be found in it, and our
language was the predominant tongue. In 1809,
by the peaceful Treaty of Friederichsham,
Finland passed for ever into the Empire. All
that then remained to be done was to take
advantage of our victories, and quietly but firmly
incorporate the conquered province with the rest
of Russia. But we did not do this. Being fully
occupied elsewhereâin fortifying our foothold
on the Black and Caspian Seas, in advancing
towards the Pacific, in a long struggle in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Caucasus, in wars with Poland and in Central
Asiaâwe paid little attention to what was going
on in Finland, and rested content with the outward
peacefulness, order, and submission of its
people. The Finns took advantage of this, and
from 1810 to 1890 unceasingly worked against
us, hoping always to succeed in obtaining complete
autonomy. In 1811 the Viborg province,
won by us at so great a cost, was again made
over to them, though they have not to this day
completely obliterated in it all traces of Russian
citizenship. Then, with the assistance of certain
of our statesmen, we learned by degrees to forget
that Finland had ever really been an integral
portion of our Empire; we were gradually taught
to feel that she ought to be administered according
to the Swedish Constitution of 1772, and,
finally, that she was not really a Russian province,
but an autonomous State. In 1880 the
law of universal military service was enacted.
This gave Finland a national armyânot a large
one, it is true, but one which, by a well-thought-out
system of reserves, enabled her to put in
the field an armed force of 100,000 men near the
Russian capital. Thus the Finns, without
shedding a drop of blood, but by working
cautiously, continuously, and systematically for
eighty years, have succeeded in again shutting us
out from the Gulfs of Finland and Bothnia, and
have, to a great extent, robbed us of the fruits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
our victories. Therefore, as the kingdom<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of Norway
and Sweden is weak, and as Finland, which
stretches almost to the walls of the Russian
capital, and screens not only it, but the whole of
Northern Russia, is of immense importance to
us, we ought, instead of planning any rectification
of the Swedish frontier, to think how best
to remove the causes of friction between the two
countries. Sweden could only hope to take
Finland from us if the Finnsâ dream of independence
came true; she could only risk operations
against us in that country if the inhabitants
joined her or were at least sympathetic. Consequently,
to insure our safety on that frontier, it is
our duty to smooth the way as much as possible
for the early unification of Finland and Russia.</p>

<p>The following is a quotation from my report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âHowever just our claims to the possession of
Finland may be, it must be acknowledged that
our mistaken policy with regard to her, lasting
for eighty years, cannot be rectified all at once.
Hasty action in dealing with matters which touch
the domestic life of a people can only irritate and
intensify difficulties. A firm and, at the same
time, cautious attitude, extending, perhaps, over
many years, is essential in order that we may be
able in the end to take our proper place on the
shores of the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.
We must be particularly careful how we introduce
any change into the peopleâs mode of life,
and must frankly admit that Finland has reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a more advanced state of civilization than many
of our provinces, although this has been done
mainly at the expense of the Russian people. We
should respect Finnish culture, in the hope that
when Finland is united to us it will assist and
not harm us.â</p></div>

<p>2. <i>Western Frontier.</i>âFrom Cape Polangen
on the Baltic Coast to the mouth of the Danube
in the Black Sea Russia marches for 738 miles
with Germany, 761 with Austro-Hungary, and
467 with Roumania.</p>

<p>The northern and southern extremities of this
frontier line are fairly straight. In the middle,
from Raigrod to Litomerj, it runs due west, and
bending round, continues for 390 miles to
Myslowitz, along the southern and eastern
frontiers of Germany, and thence for 213 miles
along the northern frontiers of Austro-Hungary.
It juts out into these States, forming our Warsaw
Military District, important both by its position
and its strategic significance. This area, formerly
the kingdom of Poland, was joined to Russia by
the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. By holding this
area we can envelop the southern frontier of
Eastern Prussia and the northern frontier of
Galicia. Operating from this theatre, we can cut
off those provinces from their neighbours by
advancing towards the Baltic Sea on the north,
or the difficult Carpathian range on the south.
On the other hand, the district is itself liable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
be cut off by offensive movements from north
and south, directed on the fortress of Brest-Litovsk.
Its position, therefore, makes it of
decided importance. Were we more ready for
war than our neighbours, it might constitute a
source of strength to us. If, on the other hand,
Germany and Austria together are able to
throw greater numbers into the field, and can
concentrate more rapidly than we can, it will
merely be a weak spot.</p>

<p>The German frontier, 738 miles in length,
follows no natural feature. Beyond it lies our
nearest neighbourâa nation with whom we have
been in close social and economic relationship
ever since we got into touch with European life.
At the present time (1900) five separate lines of
railway connect different parts of Russia with
Germanyâs Baltic ports and with Berlin; our
annual trade with her amounts to Â£32,200,000
(the average of the five years from 1893 to
1897), or, in other words, to 26Â·5 per cent. of
all our foreign trade. The yearly exports (five-years
average) amount to Â£16,400,000, or 25Â·1
per cent. of all our exports; the imports to
Â£15,800,000 (28Â·6 per cent. of our imports).
In 1897 alone our German exports totalled
Â£17,520,000, and our imports Â£17,980,000.
Thus the economic connection between the
two countries is very close. Our interests are
reciprocal, and, consequently, economic reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
alone necessitate a preservation on our part of
the present friendly relations. But it is of no
use disguising the fact that the part played by
the German Government at the Berlin Congress
gave us reason to change a policy which
had always been favourable to Germany, and her
entry into the Triple Alliance, which was directed
against us, was the origin of our <i>rapprochement</i>
with France. The whole of the frontier is artificial,
and quite exposed to invasion from either side.
From the Baltic to Filippovo it acts as an ethnographical
dividing-line between the Lithuanian
races in the east and the Germans, German Lithuanians,
and Poles on the west, and separates our
Poles from the German Poles. Though there
exists no obvious natural boundary between us
and Germany, the racial one has the same effect
as a natural boundary. By a systematic policy
Germany has succeeded in so Teutonizing the one
Slav country of Eastern Prussia that it now constitutes
one of the most loyal provinces of the
House of Hohenzollern. The same policy, with
less successful results, however, is being applied
to Posen. On our side we are making great
efforts to colonize the Warsaw Military District
and the north-western countries bordering on
Germany, so as to bind them closer to us. If
we have not been so successful in our efforts
as our neighbours, it is mainly due to the backward
state of our civilization. Our vacillations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
also, as to the best policy whereby to attain the
desired result are responsible for the slow progress
made.</p>

<p>By the expenditure of vast sums of money,
Germany has made ready in the most comprehensive
sense to march rapidly across our borders
with an army of 1,000,000 men. She has seventeen
lines of railway (twenty-three tracks) leading
to our frontiers, which would enable her to send
to the front more than 500 troop-trains daily.
She can concentrate the greater part of her
armed forces (fourteen to sixteen army corps) on
our frontier within a few days of the declaration
of war; while, apart from this question of speedy
mobilization, she has at her command far greater
technical resources, such as light railways, artillery,
ordnance, and engineering stores, particularly for
telegraphs, mobile siege-parks, etc., than we have.
She has also made most careful preparation for
a determined defence of her own border provinces,
especially those of Eastern Prussia. The first-class
fortresses of Thorn, KÃ¶nigsberg, and Posen
are improved yearly, entrenched camps are built
at the most important junctions, and material
lies ready stacked for the rapid semi-permanent
fortification of field positions.</p>

<p>The crossing-places on the Vistula have been
placed in a state of defence, as have also the
various towns and large villages. The whole
population, indeed, is making ready for a national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
struggle. Since the Crimean War we also have
worked hard to prepare the Vilna and Warsaw
areas for hostilities; but as Germany has done
considerably more in thirty years than we have
in fifty, she has outdistanced us. Her principal
and most overwhelming superiority lies in her
railways; to her seventeen lines running to our
frontier we can only oppose five. This advantage
is overwhelming, and gives to her and Austria
a superiority which can be counterbalanced
neither by large numbers nor bravery. The
fact remains that Germany, by spending milliardsâpart
of which were supplied by the war indemnity
of 1871âhas prepared for hostilities,
both in the shape of an energetic offensive and
also a determined defensive. If a war should
happen to go against us, she might attempt to
annex the whole of the Warsaw Military District,
or even part of the Vilna District (on the
left bank of the Dwina), for the peoples of these
countries might considerably augment her military
strength. On the other hand, those who
analyze the possible consequences of such a
war cannot see what advantage Germany would
derive from such expansion. It is incredible
that 100,000,000 Russians would ever become
reconciled to the loss of territory which is bound
to the Fatherland by historical ties, and which
has cost so much Russian blood. Such thinkers
are convinced, on the contrary, that we should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
concentrate ourselves on winning it back at the
very first chance. If we were better prepared
for war, or in a case where Germanyâs main
forces were diverted in another direction, the
Warsaw Military District would constitute a
<i>place dâarmes</i>, cutting deep in between her and
Austria, whence we might, with equal ease,
advance rapidly on either Berlin or Vienna.
The former is 200 and the latter 213 miles from
our frontier; St. Petersburg and Moscow are
533 and 733 miles respectively from the German,
and 900 and 800 from the Austrian, frontier. If,
however, we were successful in such a campaign,
and sought to expand the Empire further, military
considerations would point to the annexation
of the whole of Eastern Prussia up to the
Vistula. Astride this river, with possession of
both its banks and of its mouths and of the River
Niemen, we should hold a very commanding
position as regards Germany, and should have
considerably improved our military frontier.
But these advantages of position would be more
than outweighed by the many disadvantages
attending such an increase of territory. There
would arise for us a question of lost provinces
comparable to that of Alsace-Lorraine; but it
would be of a more acute nature, for the
German nation would always be watching for
an opportunity to regainâby war if necessaryâterritory
with which the ruling dynasty was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
intimately connected. It may be assumed, thereforeâ</p>

<p>That, taking the armed forces of both nations
as they exist to-day, and making allowance for
their comparative readiness, an invasion of our
territory by German armies is more probable
than a Russian invasion of Germany;</p>

<p>That an invading German army would meet
with fewer difficulties than ours if we marched
into Prussia;</p>

<p>That certain territory might be taken from us;</p>

<p>That we might take Prussian territory from
Germany, but that the population of the conquered
provinces would always be hostile to
us, on account of the difference in their state
of civilization, national ties, and traditional
sentiment;</p>

<p>That both Russia and Germany are such great
nations that neither could possibly accept a loss
of territory nor rest until it had been regained; and</p>

<p>â<i>That, taking everything into consideration, it
would not suit Germany, and it would certainly
not suit us, to go to war for the sake of altering
the existing frontier.</i>â</p>

<p class="skip2">3. <i>Austro-Hungarian Frontier.</i>âAustro-Hungary,
243,043 square miles in area, is
larger than Germany, and in 1900 its population
was 45,600,000; but while the German
nation is exceedingly homogeneous and patriotic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the people of Austro-Hungary consist of many
races. Of its population, 24Â·1 per cent. is
German; the numerous Slav groups comprise
47 per cent. (Bohemians, Moravians, and
Slovaks, 16Â·9 per cent.; Croatian-Servians,
11 per cent.; Poles, 8 per cent.; Rusins, 8 per
cent.; Slavonians, 3 per cent.); Hungarians, 16Â·2
per cent.; Roumanians, 6Â·6 per cent.; Jews,
4Â·5 per cent.; and Italians, 1Â·6 per cent. As
regards the feeling of these various races towards
Russia, the Germans who live at a distance from
our frontiers are not hostile; the Hungarians, if
not open enemies, are, at any rate, unfriendly on
account of the part we took in suppressing the
rebellion of 1849, and their latent dislike is
fanned by the greatest of the Slav groups, the
Poles. The rest of the Slavs are sympathetic
with their kinsmen in Russia, but the main
motive for this sentiment is fear lest they should
be absorbed by the Germans or Magyars.</p>

<p>The Austrian frontiers are nowhere simple,
but ever since the conclusion of the Triple Alliance
she has turned her attentionâin a military
senseâalmost exclusively to her Russian frontier.
On glancing at the map, oneâs first thought
is that the natural boundary between the two
countries should run along the Carpathian range,
but the actual frontier is a long way on the Russian
side of it. Galicia forms, so to speak, a
glacis of this main obstacle (the Carpathians)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
running down towards Russia, and it has recently
grown up into a splendidly prepared
entrenched camp, connected to the other provinces
of Austro-Hungary by numerous roads
across the Carpathians. It is strongly fortified
and stocked with supplies of every nature, both
for a protracted defence or an advance in force
into Russia. Austria can now concentrate
1,000,000 men in this area within a very short
space of time. For 760 miles we have a common
frontier, and the upper reaches of the Vistulaâfrom
Nepolomnitsa to Zavikhostâand a small
stretch of the Dniester, with its tributary, the
Zbruoz, form a natural boundary in this direction.
These rivers, however, possess no strategic
value. The frontier is crossed by four lines of
railway:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) At Granitsa, on the Warsaw-Ivangorod
line.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At Radziviloff.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) At Volochisk.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) At Novoselits.</p>

<p>Our economic relations with Austro-Hungary
are not so important as those with Germany. For
the five years 1893â97 the average value of our
trade has amounted to only Â£5,800,000 per annum,
or 4Â·5 per cent. of our total trade; of this, the
exports are Â£3,500,000, and the imports Â£2,320,000
(4Â·8 and 4Â·2 per cent. of the respective totals). In
1897 our exports were Â£3,900,000, and imports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Â£19,000,000. Though almost half the races of
Austro-Hungary come of kindred stock to our
people, and though much of our blood was shed
in the nineteenth century in order to maintain
the reigning house of Austria on the throne, war
between the two nations is by no means impossible
in the event of a general European conflagration,
for brothers by blood and religion will
march against brothers. Such a war, which
would, except in the imagination of a few Polish
dreamers, be a calamity for all the Slav races,
could not be popular with the Austrian-Germans,
however much their interests may be
opposed to ours. In Austro-Hungary it is the
Hungarians and Poles alone who hate us, having,
as is well known, many and good reasons for
siding with our possible foes. Upon the subject
of a change of our frontier after war with Austria,
I wrote in my report of 1900 as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âIn the event of a successful war with us, the
Austro-Hungarian Governmentâunder pressure
from the Polesâwould probably insist on the
annexation to Galicia of those Russian border-lands
where the Poles predominate. Some of
the Polish and Hungarian patriots even aspire to
moving the Russian frontier back to Brest and
the Dnieper.</p>

<p>âIt is certain that Russia would never accept
any loss of territory, even after defeat, and would
do her utmost to win back as quickly as possible
any which had been taken. On the other hand,
after a successful war against Austro-Hungary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and the probably ensuing break-up of that Empire,
Russia will be confronted with the problem
of whether she should take more territory, and if
so, what? There would then recur the cry for
the ârectification of the frontier.â The Carpathian
Mountains seem formed by Nature for a boundary,
so that the whole of Galicia might become
part of Russia.</p>

<p>âBut we must put the position before ourselves
clearly and in good time. Is such an
increase of land and population necessary to us?
Should we be the stronger for such annexation,
or, on the other hand, should we be creating a
source of weakness and anxiety for ourselves?
Seventy or a hundred years ago a transfer of
Galicia might very likely have been of advantage
and have added to our strength, though even
that is problematical, for it is by no means certain
that Austria would not have tried to win it
back; she would have had an excellent opportunity
in 1855. But now, after Galicia has for
so long existed apart from us, it could only be
torn from Austria by force, and therefore unwillingly.
Neither the Poles of Galicia nor its
Russian population are anxious to become Russian
subjects. We must not lose sight of the
fact that for the Slavs of Austria, including the
Rusins, we can only be a means to an end (emancipation),
not an end in ourselves. Even the
Bulgarians and Servians might turn against us.
Nor are the Austrian Slavs in real need of our
help. Every year they are gaining, by persistency
and peaceful methods, more and more civil rights,
which are gradually placing them on an equality
with the Germans and the Hungarians. Notwithstanding
their grave economic position; notwithstanding
the grip the Jews are getting on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the land, or the taxes, which are heavier than in
Russia, and the inequality of rights of Poles and
Rusins, the people of Galicia consider themselves
far more advanced than their Russian neighbours.
In their opinion it would be a retrograde step to
become Russian subjects. This is also a point
we must always keep clearly in our minds, lest
we imagine that we have only to move into
Eastern Galicia for the people to rise against the
Austriansâtheir eternal oppressors. If, on the
contrary, we allow ourselves to be led away by
the prospect of rounding off our possessions by
means of natural boundaries, we shall certainly
lay up endless trouble and expense for ourselves
in the future. Joined to Russia, Galicia might
in a lesser degree become an Alsace-Lorraine for
us, just as Eastern Prussia would be.â</p></div>

<p>In the matter of railway development the
Austrians also have left us far behind. While
they, by means of eight lines of rail (ten tracks),
can run 260 trains up to the frontier every twenty-four
hours, we can only convey troops up to the
same point on four lines! As any of their troops
on the frontier would be in advance of the Carpathians,
this range was formerly looked upon as
an obstacle to retirement and to communication
between Galicia and the rest of Austria. But in
the last ten years it has been pierced by five lines
of railway, and preparations have been made to
lay three more. Notwithstanding our unreadiness,
the Austrians, even if egged on by the Germans,
would not lightly attack us, for they well
know that they would meet a determined foe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and be committed to a national war. On the
other hand, we must not deceive ourselves with
any idea that we could easily defeat the Austrians.
Their army, which is of great size and
splendidly equipped, would base itself upon the
strong entrenched camp in Galicia, and could, if
properly commanded, throw superior numbers
into the field against us. I recorded the following
conclusions upon the Austrian frontier in my
report of 1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>â<i>It would be advantageous to neither Austria
nor Russia to engage in war in order to bring
about an alteration of the existing frontier.</i></p>

<p>âIt is satisfactory to be able to draw such conclusions
regarding our frontiers with these two
powerful States. Having no desire for our neighboursâ
land, and being at the same time quite
prepared to make any sacrifice for the defence of
our own country, we may hope that if we on our
side have no reason to force on a war, our neighbours
will, on their side, use every means to avoid
beginning one with us.â</p></div>


<p>4. <i>Roumanian Frontier.</i>âFor 466 miles south
of Austro-Hungary we march with Roumania.
The frontier runs along the River Pruth and the
northern branch of the delta of the Danube. It
is there formed by a natural line of water; it fully
meets our requirements, political and military,
and therefore calls for no change. The young
kingdom of Roumania, consisting of some 51,000
square miles, with a population of 5,000,000, is
one of the second-class Powers of Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Our trade with her amounts roughly (taking
the average from 1893â97) to Â£1,020,000 per
annum, constituting OÂ·8 per cent. of our foreign
trade. Our exports amount, on the average, to
Â£750,000 per annum (1Â·3 per cent. of our total
exports). Two lines of railway run to the
frontier from our side: one to Ungens, whence it
continues on to Jassy; the other to Reni, whence
communication extends to Galatz by road, there
being no bridge across the Pruth. Although
Roumania owes her very existence to Russia, the
close relations into which she has entered with
Germany, and still more with Austro-Hungary,
and her evident anxiety to develop her army and
fortify her frontier on our side, point in no uncertain
manner to the possibility of her taking up
arms against us in a European war. The reason
may be that she wishes, in the event of such a
conflict, to wrest from us Bessarabia, half the
population of that province being Roumanian.</p>

<p class="skip2">5. In <i>Trans-Caucasia</i> we march for 325 miles
with Turkey and 465 with Persia. The territory
of the former is in three continents, and amounts
to 1,581,400 square miles, with a population of
40,000,000. Our trade with her (taking the
same years as before) reaches Â£2,110,000 per
annum, or 2Â·1 per cent. of our total foreign
trade. The frontier was fixed after our victorious
campaign of 1877â78. As it runs for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
part along natural boundaries, such as watersheds,
it not only effectually guarantees the
integrity of our possessions from any Turkish
attempt at aggression, but it gives us an advantageous
route by which to advance on Erzeroum,
the most important point in Asia Minor, and
the only fortress of any strength nearer than
Scutari. Thus, the present frontier may be
accepted as being quite satisfactory from our
point of view, and no change is necessary.
</p>

<p>In Europe we have no long land frontier with
Turkey, as Roumania and Bulgaria lie between us.
The only point at which we are in direct touch
with her on the mainland is in the Caucasus, and
this is the only point where we can engage her by
a direct advance across the frontier. But though
we are content with our position, we must not
forget that Turkey, given a favourable opportunity,
might make an effort to regain the
territory we have taken from her. To make our
position on her frontier safe, we should pacify
the Caucasus, improve the conditions of the
people and our organization of troops there, and
strengthen our command of the Black Sea.</p>


<p class="skip2">6. <i>East of Turkey</i> we march with Persia for
465 miles in Trans-Caucasia, to the east again
for 275 along the Caspian Sea, and further still
to the east on land for 593 miles up to Zulfikar
on the Heri Rud. Including the Caspian shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
we have a common frontier with Persia of
1,333 miles.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Our trade with her has gradually
increased in the last ten years from Â£2,000,000
in 1888 to Â£3,500,000 in 1897. Of all our land-borne
commerce, this is only exceeded by our
trade with Germany, Austria, and China. In
nine years our exports have risen from Â£900,000
to Â£1,600,000, and our imports from Â£1,100,000
to Â£1,900,000. Our exports have, however, been
artificially stimulated by very heavy rebates on
the export tax on sugar and cotton, and the
imports diminished by the high taxes on tea
brought through Persia (from China and India)
and an almost prohibitive tariff on foreign manufactured
goods. Her situation on the Indian
Ocean, upon the shortest route to India from
Europe, combined with the undeveloped state of
her resources and her military weakness, makes
Persia the natural arena for any struggle between
the great Powers for predominance in the Middle
East. Hitherto Russia and Great Britain have
been the principal competitors, but Germany is
now apparently ready to join in the race, for she
is making serious efforts to establish her footing
in Asia Minor. The fact that we are neighbours
over an immense length; our long-standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
peaceful relationship;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the privileges we enjoy
from the Treaty of Gulistan, which give us a
word in the internal administration of the country,
and permit us to maintain exclusive supremacy
on the Caspian, which washes the defenceless
shores of Northern Persia; and, finally, our complete
military superiority, can be said to confer
at present on Russia an effective political
predominance in the country. As regards
economic predominance, we have in our hands
only the trade of the three northern provinces;
throughout the rest of the country it does not
belong to us. In the southern provinces it is
almost entirely in the hands of Great Britain.
By seizing points on the coast of the Indian
Ocean, by constructing railways<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and developing
her trade with Persia, Great Britain apparently
aspires not only to make certain of supremacy in
the south, but gradually to capture the trade of
the central provinces, and even to compete with
us in the north. Germany will also soon be a
serious competitor of ours; she already controls
the important trade route from Trebizond to
Tabriz. The following is the conclusion I
recorded in the report I have quoted from above:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âOur Persian frontier has been settled and
delimitated along its whole length, and neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
for strategic nor other reasons is any change
desirable; nor do we wish to obtain any further
concessions of land from Persia. On the contrary,
not only would the acquirement of fresh
districts filled by alien peoples, and the consequent
expense of administration, be of no advantage to
us, but any action likely to undermine the
friendly feelings now underlying all our dealings
with the Persians would be distinctly detrimental
to our interests. From the military standpoint,
there appears to be no need to realign the
frontier. It separates kindred races only for a
short distanceâ<i>i.e.</i>, the Persians and Turkomans
in Lenkoran and along the Artek. Following
natural landmarks for the rest of its length, it
acts as a racial divisionâin Trans-Caucasia
between the Armenians and Turks; in Azerbaijan
between the Persians, Turko-Tartars, and the
Kurds; in Central Asia between the Turkomans
and Russians of Trans-Caucasia, and the Kurds
and Persians of Khorasan. For the last fifty
years our trade with Persia, taking imports and
exports, has increased enormously, and it is now
our duty to preserve and develop it, and to take
every step in order that the northern markets
may, year by year, become more completely
dominated by us; but a further growth of trade
is only possible if the people of the country feel
secure and internal order is maintained. By the
conquest of the Turkomans twenty years ago
we guaranteed peaceful development to the
people of Khorasan, and we are now reaping the
fruits of our victory at Geok Tepe, for our trade
in Khorasan alone amounts to about Â£10,000,000
a year. If, therefore, the necessity should arise
in the future, it will certainly be our duty to
assist the Persian Government to maintain order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in those portions of country nearest to our border.
Consequently, our most urgent duties in Persia
are, at present, the maintenance of order in the
provinces nearest us, and of our command of the
markets in the north of the country.â</p></div>


<p>7. <i>Eastwards</i> again from the Persian frontier
runs that of Afghanistan, which has not long
been delimitated. It is 1,259 miles long, and
traverses a desert as far as the Oxus, and then
runs along that river. This frontier is satisfactory,
and well defined.</p>

<p>Bounded on the west by Persia, on the south
and east by Baluchistan and the Indian Empire,
Afghanistan contains the immense range of the
Hindu Kush Mountains, with their numerous
ramifications. In size it is some 217,800 square
miles, with a population of 5,000,000 to 6,000,000,
of which 56 per cent. are Afghan and 44 per
cent. non-Afghan tribes. As it lies between our
territory in Central Asia and Great Britainâs
Indian Empire, it has long been an object of
interest to the British, who have desired to
establish in it an exclusive supremacy. Being
afraid of an attempt on our part to march on
India, they have followed our every move in
Central Asia with a vigilant eye. So long ago
as 1873 they tried to arrive at an agreement
with us whereby, if they refrained from interference
in Bokhara, we, on our side, should
undertake to abstain from any intervention in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Afghanistan. Since then they have moved
forward several steps on the frontiers of the
country, and have even annexed a portion of it.
But in proportion as they have advanced beyond
the Indus, they have, instead of assuring more
peace upon the border, met greater difficulties,
with the result that their present position on the
north-west frontier of India is unsettled and
unsatisfactory. Afghanistan has not only not
become British, but under twenty years of
Abdur Rahmanâs energetic administration has
become strongerâso much so that it is now
really an independent empire,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> with a sound
military organization. As regards the countryâs
sentiments, it is as hostile to us as it is to the
British.</p>

<p>Since 1873 we also have greatly added to our
possessions in Central Asia. We conquered
Turkomania and the Khanate of Khokand, defeated
the inhabitants of Khiva, and turned it
into a trading centre; and although we did not
annex Bokhara, by running a railway through it
and including it within our fiscal area we secured
absolute supremacy. In this way we pushed
our frontiers on to Persia and Afghanistan,
and, having drawn our boundary along natural
features, we now possess a clearly defined line
along the whole of which we are blessed with
peace. The conclusion I came to regarding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Afghan frontier was expressed as follows in my
report of 1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âIf we compare the success of British policy
in India since 1873 with the results of our
progress in Central Asia, we have reason to
congratulate ourselves. We are at present better
and more peacefully established than they are.
There would not be any advantage in changing
our present position for a worse one, which
we would certainly do if we annexed part of
Afghanistan. Since the non-Afghan peoples of
Northern Afghanistan wish to be taken over by
us, it would seem natural that we should annex
Afghan Turkestan and the Herat province.
Such annexation would bring us over 2,000,000
new subjects, of whom the majority are industrious
and skilled tillers of the soil; would
advance our frontier to the Hindu Kush, which
has long been the dream of many Russians; and
would give us possession of the far-famed Herat,
a place most undoubtedly of great strategical
importance. At first sight the gain seems indisputable;
but from a closer study of the
subject, it is clear that the result of the realization
of these schemes would be to create for
ourselves immense difficulties in the present and
possible danger in the future. In the first place,
the geographical boundaries would not coincide
with the ethnographical. For, in moving our
frontier up to the edge of the Hindu Kush, we
should be forced to take over tribes of Afghan
descent, and yet at the same time exclude some
non-Afghan races kindred to those we had
already taken over. This in itself bristles with
difficulties. Where the inhabitants of the valleys
are peasants, Uzbegs, and Tajiks, they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
probably submit to us without opposition, but
the hillmen, even those of non-Afghan descent,
would fight fiercely for their liberty. Even after
conquering them, we, like the British in India
to-day, would have no peace. Continual risings
would take place along our new frontier, the
hillmen from Afghanistan proper would begin
to raid just as the tribes do on the Indian border,
and continual expeditions would be necessary.
We should be compelled in the end, just as the
British have been, to move the frontier forward
repeatedly, and to absorb more territory. So
it would go on until our frontier eventually
coincided with that of British India. Immense
sums of money would be required for the organization
and administration of the country taken
over, for the construction of roads and fortified
positions for large numbers of troops, and to
meet the cost of expeditions, etc. Finally, it
must be remembered that the people of Afghan
Turkestan and Herat, who now look on us as
their liberators from Afghan oppression, might,
when taken over, change their feeling towards
us. The consequence would be that, instead of
keeping neighbours well disposed towards us,
and ready to assist us when called upon, we
should be acquiring fresh responsibilities in the
shape of discontented subjects, who would require
military garrisons for their control.â</p></div>

<p>In 1878â<i>i.e.</i>, twenty-seven years agoâwhen
I was in the Asiatic Section of the Headquarters
Staff, I was convinced of the necessity for Russia
and Great Britain to work together harmoniously
in Asia, and I was opposed to every plan
of offensive operations towards India. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
our brush with the Afghans at Kushk in 1885,
when relations with Great Britain became very
strained, and a rupture might have occurred at
any moment, we made preparations to concentrate
an army in Central Asia in case the British
should declare war. I was nominated for the
appointment of Chief of the Staff to this force,
and at the committee meetings, over which
General Vannovski presided, I expressed my
opinion openly as to the necessity for a peaceful
agreement with Great Britain. I pointed out
that the interests of the two Powers on the
continent of Asia were identical, for both had
to reckon with the natural desire of conquered
nationalities to overthrow their masters, and that
it would therefore be far more rational for our
troops in Central Asia to assist Great Britain in
her struggle with the local peoples than for us
to advance towards India with the object of
raising it against the British. When I was in
command of the Trans-Caspian district from
1890 to 1898, I did everything within my power
to maintain peace on the Afghan border, and,
after I had succeeded in obtaining the construction
of a railway to Kushk, I urged the
necessity of coming to an agreement with Great
Britain, so that, by joining up the railway
systems of India and Turkestan, we might once
for all put an end to our rivalry in the Middle
East. I still continued to advocate an agreement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
after becoming War Minister, and my rÃ©sumÃ© on
the Afghan frontier in the report already quoted
concluded with the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âI cannot but express my firm conviction that
the connection of the Indian and Central Asian
railway systems by a line from Chaman to
Kushk, via Kandahar and Herat, would create
a line of international importance. Such a line
would in the future assist the peaceful delimitation
of our sphere of influence in Afghanistan,
and if Great Britain will abandon her policy of
everywhere putting impediments in our path,
would facilitate a <i>rapprochement</i><a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> based upon the
mutual interests of the two nations. Absolutely
convinced as I am that the possession of India
would in twenty yearsâ time be a misfortune and
an insupportable burden for Russia, I consider
it both natural and right that we should establish
an <i>entente</i> with Great Britain, so that in
case of any great rising in India we should be on
the side of the British. The twentieth century
must see a great conflict between the Christian
and the other nationalities in Asia. It is essential
for the welfare of humanity that we should in
such case be allied with the Christian Power
against the pagan races.â</p></div>

<p>My opinions on the Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese frontiers I will, on account of their
importance, quote verbatim, where possible, from
my report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âFrom the Pamirs almost to the Pacific, we
march with China for 6,074 miles. China is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
about 4,267,000 square miles in extent, and
contains about 400,000,000 inhabitants, so
that it has the largest population in the world.
The great mass of the people are Buddhists,
about 20,000,000 are Mohammedans, and about
1,150,000 Christians. Our trade with China,
which has been gradually increasing during the
last ten years, has risen from Â£3,100,000 in 1888
to Â£4,560,000 in 1897.</p>

<p>âNotwithstanding the immense length of
this frontier, our exports are insignificant; but
it is to be hoped that the railway-line through
Manchuria, with its branch to Port Arthur, will
alter this unprofitable state of affairs in our
favour.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Although we have had relations with
China for two centuries, and although our
frontiers are identical for over 6,000 miles, they
have not once been violated by military operations.
The number of troops kept in Siberia
has always been exceedingly small. This has
been due to the generally peaceful disposition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the Chinese, to the position of the River Amur,
and other natural obstaclesâlofty mountain
ranges and vast steppesâand to the absence of
any really close tie between China and her
subject races nearest to our frontier.</p>

<p>âOur occupation of the Ussuri district necessitated
raising new bodies of troops for garrison
purposes. Finally, the Chino-Japanese War and
its consequences compelled us to take further
and rapid action to strengthen our forces in the
Far East. This war showed up the extreme
political weakness of China on the one hand, and
the great power and energy of Japan on the
otherâfacts of immense significance in East
Asian affairs. Our frontier with China is of such
length that we naturally cannot remain indifferent
to this development. Japan betrayed an
intention of taking possession of Korea, our
neighbour; we were therefore compelled, by
force of circumstances, to establish a sort of
temporary protectorate over it, and, by an
agreement with Japan, Korea was declared to
be independent, and was ostensibly left to itself.
But we did not confine ourselves to this. For
the great services we had rendered China in
the war, we obtained on commercial pretexts a
concession for a railway through Manchuria
from Trans-Baikalia to Vladivostok, and as the
immediate consequence of this, we found it
necessary to try and get a concession of part
of the Kuan-tung Peninsula, with the ports of
Dalny and Port Arthur.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This forward policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
compelled us to augment our forces in the east
with troops withdrawn from European Russia,
thereby weakening, to a certain extent, our
position in the west.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Notwithstanding the
more active line we have taken up, and the
inclusion of the whole of Manchuria within our
sphere of influence, we must remember that we
are at present quite content with our frontier,
and that to change it by the annexation of any
portion of Manchuria, for instance, would be in
the highest degree undesirable.</p>

<p>âOn the extreme western side our boundary,
running along the lofty spurs of the Tian-Shan
Mountains, is so strong by nature that, although
the people of Kashgaria on one side of it are
racially akin to our native population in Eastern
Turkestan on the other, there would be no gain
in altering the boundary. Further north the
border-line bisects the basin of the Ili, peopled
partly by tribes of the same race. Annexation
of the fertile province of Kuldja, projecting like
a strong bastion to the east, would, on the
contrary, have been of some advantage to us, as
it would have facilitated defence, and would have
acted as a menace to the Chinese. Such an advantage
is of minor importance, however, and not
enough to warrant impairing our relations with
China. All the way to Manchuria the boundary-line
runs across the Mongolian steppes, where
its position is sufficiently strong for us to cope
both with local conditions and with Chinaâs lack
of control over her border tribes. Finally, in
the extreme eastâin Manchuriaâthe frontier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is less assured, and, owing to the construction of
a line of railway to connect the Ussuri district
with Trans-Baikalia by the shortest route through
Manchuria, our position has become disquieting.</p>

<p>âAs regards the position of the Chinese
province between the Amur district on the
north, the Ussuri district on the north-east, and
the Kuan-tung Peninsula on the south, the question
naturally arises: What shall we do with it
in the future? To annex it would be very
unprofitable, not to mention the fact that the
seizure of thisâone of the most important
provinces of Chinaâwould for ever destroy the
ancient peaceful relationship between China and
ourselves. It would result in many Manchurians
settling in our territory, in the Amur and Ussuri
districts, which now are only thinly peopled by
Russians, and our weak colonies would be
swamped by the flowing tide of yellow. Eastern
Siberia would become quite un-Russian, and it
must be remembered that it is the Russians
alone who form, and will form in the future, the
reliable element of the population. Such an
inrush of Chinese into the Pri-Amur district
would undoubtedly improve the standard of its
agriculture and convert its deserts into flowering
gardens; but, at the same time, surplus land in
Siberia, every acre of which we ought to preserve
for our own people, would be passing into the
hands of non-Russian races. The population of
Russia of the twentieth century will need it
all. As this will probably amount to some
400,000,000 in the year 2000, we must begin
now to set aside land for at least a quarter of
this number. It would, therefore, be preferable
if Manchuria remained an integral part of China.
But if we decide against its annexation, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
ought undoubtedly to take every means to
obtain absolute commercial control, consolidating
our position by constructing lines through it,
such as the Trans-Baikal-Vladivostok and Port
Arthur railways. We should not obtain any
further concessions from China, but our policy
towards her in the near future should beâ</p>

<p>â1. Not to permit any increase in, nor development
of the training of, her armed forces, particularly
in the north, and to forbid the presence
of foreign military instructors in that quarter.</p>

<p>â2. To develop our social and commercial
relations with her as much as possible, in the
northern provinces to commence with.</p>

<p>â3. To avoid as far as possible any dispute on
her soil with other European nations, to insure
which we should confine our attentions to North
China, and undertake no railway enterprises
south of the Great Wall, more especially in the
Yang-tsze Valley.</p>

<p>âThe last portion of our frontier marches with
Korea, a country with an area of 80,000 square
miles, and containing a population of at least
11,000,000, amongst whom are only some 2,000
to 10,000 Chinese, 45,000 to 55,000 Japanese,
and some 300 Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The position of
Korea is peculiar; she is subordinate both to
China and Japan, and yet, since 1897âby the
agreement between ourselves and the latter
Powerâher independence has been acknowledged.
Extreme caution is therefore demanded
in our dealings with and our policy concerning
her. Though we feel no necessity to annex the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
country ourselves, we can under no circumstances
consent to the establishment in it of an
energetic Japan or any other Power. For the
present, a Korea, weak, independent, but under
our protection, is for us the simplest solution of
the question. The immediate establishment of
a Protectorate would not only necessitate all
sorts of expense, but might drag us unprepared
into war. And so in this case, just as in Persia
and in North China, we must work systematically
towards gradually acquiring absolute economic
control of the country. The occupation of the
Kuan-tung Peninsula, the permanent fortification
of our position there, and the completion
of the roads running through Manchuria,
are steps in advance, and important ones, in
this problem of the future. <i>At present we
are in no way ready to take an active line in
Korea, and must, at any cost, avoid stirring up
a conflict with Japan on account of Korean affairs.</i></p>

<p>âWe are certain to encounter Japanâs strenuous
opposition in our endeavour to obtain control of
the Korean markets, even if it be only in the
shape of political or mere trade competition, and
if we cannot altogether avoid a conflict, we shall
in all probability have to fight her in the beginning
of the twentieth century.â</p></div>

<p>From this very brief survey of our frontiers it
is seen how we are for over 11,000 miles in touch
with nine States, and nowhere wish any realignment
of our frontier. This is highly satisfactory,
and if we are content with our present boundaries,
and concern ourselves in the present century
solely with the consolidation of the position
we have gained during the past 200 years, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
danger of war with our neighbours seems remote.
For the present generation such a course is absolutely
essential. Immense were the sacrifices
made by our forebears in adding to our great
Empire, but the struggle which is even now
necessary to preserve the existence of our frontier
regions is so severe that it is retarding still
further the naturally slow economic development
of the mass of the people in Russia itself. Our
border districts exist, in fact, at the expense of
the interior of the country, and have up to the
present been a source of weakness rather than of
strength to the Empire at large. So over-burdened
is the present generation with the
many requirements necessary for their administration
and defence, that to undertake at the
same time any fresh foreign enterprises may
soon become quite beyond our powers. But
with a growing population, will our Empire be
content with the existing frontiers, or will
Russia have to solve further problems of expansion?
And what will they be? Such was
the question I put to myself in submitting my
report. I considered it natural that Russia,
âwithout increasing her extent either in Europe
or Asia,â should try in the twentieth century to
gain access to warm seas, which are ice-free all
the year round, such as the inner Mediterranean
seas and the outlets which are open all the year
round into the Pacific and Indian Oceans. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
regards the difficulties and dangers in undertaking
these schemes I said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âHowever natural our wishes may be to
possess an outlet from the Black Sea and access
to the Indian or to the Pacific Oceans, such aims
could not be realized without inflicting grave
injury upon the interests of almost the whole
world. In fact, so much is this the case, that in
the pursuit of such aims we must be prepared
to fight combinations of any of the following
nations: Great Britain, Germany, Austria,
Turkey, China, and Japan. It is not the actual
move on our part to any of the above-mentioned
places that is feared by others, but the consequence
of such a moveâif successful. The
possession of the Bosphorus and the passage
into the Mediterranean would enable us to take
decisive action as regards the Egyptian question,
and to make the Suez Canal international,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
our presence on the Indian Ocean would be a
continual menace to India. But the chief disturbing
element in the minds of the more
advanced nations of Europe and America (which
are now the factories and workshops of the whole
world) would be the fear of our competition in
the marts of the world. Having in our hands
the main lines of railway connecting the Pacific
Ocean and the Baltic Sea, with feeder lines from
the Bosphorus, the Indian and Pacific Oceans, we
could, with our inexhaustible natural wealth,
control the industry of the globe.â</p></div>

<p>Such has been the recent growth of armaments
among all nations that the difficulties which will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
confront us in any effort to reach warm seas in
this century will absolutely put into the shade
any faced by us in the past, and the powers of
the present generation may well prove unequal
to the effort required to gain what is, after all,
only necessary for our childrenâs children. Indeed,
a comparison of fighting strengths leads to the
inevitable conclusion that not only is the present
generation too weak to undertake fresh tasks to
secure what is necessary for the existence of the
400,000,000 of our future population, but that
the relative greater power of our probable
enemies makes it extremely difficult to guarantee
the integrity of the Empire. The following is
the reference to this point in my report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âWithin the last fifty years the military
resources of our neighbours have so increased,
and Germany and Austria, more especially, are
so much better prepared to invade us, that our
western frontier is now exposed to greater danger
than it has ever been in the whole of our history.</p>

<p>âOur military position on the Turkish frontier
also is no longer as favourable as it was in the
beginning of the nineteenth century. This is
particularly the case now that Germany seems
to be taking so much interest in Turkish affairs.
Again, the defence of the Caucasus has also become
difficult. So, too, on the Afghan frontier we
now have powerful neighbours, who in organization
and armament are more on a level with our
troops in Turkestan than they were in the beginning
of the last century. An Afghan invasion
of our territory is by no means an impossibility, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
fact which complicates considerably the defence
of Turkestan.</p>

<p>âChina is at present alone in having no army
worthy of serious consideration, and she is impotent
against us in the Pri-Amur<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or Kuan-tung
districts. But in the place of a weak China has
arisen a powerful Japan, whose armed forces
may prove a danger to our troops in the Far
East until sufficient reinforcements can be sent
out.</p>

<p>âStill, notwithstanding our great length of
frontier to be defended and the immense development
in the military power of our neighbours,
the difficulties in the way of defeating
us on our own soil are so obvious and so great
that, if we confine our actions to self-defence, no
enemy will be likely to attack us.â</p></div>

<p>Finally, an analysis of the strength and
resources of our nearest neighbours forced me
to the conclusion that â<i>our western frontier
has never in the whole history of Russia been
exposed to such danger in the event of a European
war as it is now, and that accordingly the attention
of the War Department in the first years of
the present century should be confined to strengthening
our position on that side, and not diverted
to aggressive enterprises elsewhere</i>.â</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="capsub">The expansion in numbers of our army in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, the suitability of our peace
and war establishments, and the growth of our neighboursâ
forcesâThe growing complication of our defence
problems towards the end of the last century.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the year 1700 our forces numbered 56,000;
in 1800, 400,000; while in 1894 our war strength
amounted to 2,000,000; but the growth in the
nineteenth century was attended by great fluctuations
as compared with the gradual increase
in the previous 100 years. The universal dissatisfaction
with the results of the Crimean War
first brought about the awakening of public feeling
which ended in the emancipation of the serfs,
and the great efforts in the direction of economy
made at that time led directly to the reduction
of the army. Even while the guns were booming
at KÃ¶niggrÃ¤tz in 1866, our standing army in
Europe was cut down from 600,000 to 372,000
men. It was not long, however, before the
Franco-German War opened our eyes to possible
dangers from the west. Up to that time
we had been living upon tradition, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
experiences of the days when war was waged by
standing armies, and did not call for the mobilization
of the whole of a nationâs forces; when
armies moved by road, and several months elapsed
between the declaration of war and the first decisive
engagement. By her rapid concentration
and by her ability to throw an immense army so
quickly across the French frontier in 1870, Germany
showed also what she would be capable of
doing in our direction. We had for a long time
neglected to keep up the fortifications on our
western frontier, lest we should give Germany
cause to suspect that we distrusted the long-standing
traditional good feeling between the reigning
Houses. The speed, however, with which she
disposed, first of Austria, then of France, her
immense increase in power, and her evident
ambition not only to protect herself, but to gain
the hegemony of Europe, together formed a
menace against which we were forced to take
strong measures. Accordingly our army was
again increased as quickly as possible, and between
the years 1869 and 1880 the peace strength of
the forces in European Russia rose from 366,000
to 535,000 men, arrangements at the same time
being made for the mobilization of a field army
of 1,500,000. But during the same period our
neighbours were able to perfect their own arrangements
still more, both in the number of
men mobilized and the speed of their concentration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
From a force whose strength was the
same in peace and war our war army now became
so large that it merited the title of ânational.â
But even a national army is not enough nowadays.
For the successful conduct of a conflict
against a powerful opponent, a struggle which
calls for the exertion of every effortâmoral,
mental, and physicalâthe whole nation itself
must take part. In other words, to achieve success
with an army mainly composed of men called
up for actual operations, the people must be
in sympathy with it, must recognize the importance
and magnitude of its task, and must back
it up unreservedly.</p>

<p>The war of 1870â71 was prosecuted by the
Germans in a truly national spirit. The attitude
of all grades of society towards the racial struggle
entered upon by their Government was one of
the highest patriotism. The good tone and unselfish
devotion of the troops was well supported
by the wave of patriotic feeling which, starting
with the Prussians, ran through all the German
nationalities from King down to peasant. It is
a platitude that the German school-teacher was
the real victor in the war of 1870â71. This figure
of speech can perhaps be more truthfully expressed
in another way: the French were not
conquered by the German troops, but by the
German nation, which gave to the army both its
sons and its moral support. There was no such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
close union between the French Emperor, the
French army, and the French people. It was
not France which fought Germany, but the
French army. The result we know. When the
country was overrun by the invader, the people,
with few exceptions, did not exhibit a proper
patriotic spirit, nor did they assist the soldiers to
wage a national war. Some of the intelligent
sections of the populace, indeed, thought fit to
carry on an internal strife directed towards the
overthrow of their Government whilst the war
was actually in progress, and as soon as the
Imperial forces were beaten and the Emperor
taken prisoner, they succeeded in their effort.</p>

<p>In this sense we fought against Turkey under
favourable conditions in 1877â78. The sympathies
of our people for the closely related Slav
races in the Balkan Peninsula had been aroused
by the preceding struggle of the Servians against
the Turks, and we were, moreover, fighting our
traditional enemy. Consequently, many volunteers
and large sums of money found their way
from Russia into Servia. Society, worked up by
the Press, was deeply moved, and brought pressure
upon the Government to declare war, while
active operations were of course the one desire of
our soldiers. The eventual declaration of hostilities
was hailed with acclamation. As has been
explained, the slowness of our concentration in
Bessarabia permitted the further training of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
troops, especially of the reservists, and of the
selection of the best men for command, and we
consequently moved into Turkey fairly well prepared.
Our troops were in the best of spirits,
and their belief in victory boundless. But valuable
time had elapsed, and the resistance of the
Turks was far more determined than anything
we had expected. However, we reinforced
rapidly, broke down all opposition, and eventually
reached the walls of Constantinople. It really
seemed as if we were on this occasion about to
take full advantage of what had been done by
our army, and place the protection of our Black
Sea coast on a permanent basis. But we hesitated
and delayed operations in front of the
enemyâs capital, and so allowed the fruit of our
military success to be snatched from us by the
ill-timed action of diplomacy. Great Britainâs
incorrect appreciation of the Eastern Question
in 1877, combined with our distrust of Austria,
and, most important of all, the fact that we were
tired of war in high quarters, led to results quite
out of proportion to the sacrifices we had made.
When the Agreement of San Stefano was replaced
by the Treaty of Berlin, the national
feeling of optimistic patriotism gave way to
general dissatisfaction. Victors in war, we had
been beaten in politics.</p>

<p>Within twenty-five years Russia waged two
European wars, which were prematurely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
concluded. In 1850 at Sevastopol we acknowledged
ourselves beaten at a moment when our enemies
were themselves powerless to proceed. In 1878,
though we had reached the very walls of Constantinople,
we did not occupy it, and though we
had conquered the country, we acknowledged
that we alone were not strong enough to
guarantee the peaceful development even of
those districts of the Black Sea littoral which
had belonged to us before. But these results,
though surprising and disappointing to the army
and the nation at large, brought their compensations.
It was the Berlin Congress that proved
to us in unmistakable terms that we were alone
on the Continent of Europe, and showed how
necessary it was for us to set our house in order
on the western border, if we did not wish to be
taken unawares by neighbours already prepared.
But it was no simple matter to improve our
military position on that sideâespecially towards
Germanyâso that it might be on a level with
that of our possible adversary. It meant large
expenditure in the construction and improvement
of fortresses, the making of roads, and the collection
of reserves of supplies, at a time when our
financial resources had been crippled, and the
War Department, instead of having increased
funds at its disposal, was receiving a smaller
grant than before the war. In our generosity
we had taken so small an indemnity from Turkey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and had allowed payment to be spread over so
long a period, that it could not be usedâas was
Franceâs indemnity to Germanyâas an âiron
fundâ towards the expenses of the war and the
betterment of the army. About this time, also,
the feeling of disquiet caused by the state of our
western frontier was increased by fresh complications
arising on the Asiatic side of the Empire.</p>

<p>The first time we made any effort to use our
position in Central Asia indirectly in furtherance
of our general policy was in 1878, when we sent
a force to Djam (near Samarkand), with the
object of causing embarrassment to Great Britain,
then at war with Afghanistan. This attempt to
force Great Britain to give us a free hand in
the Near East by means of pressure applied
elsewhere (on the Afghan frontier) was not
successful. By Stolietoffâs mission to Kabul the
Afghans were assured of Russian assistance
against Great Britain, but when the British
marched into their country in force we held
aloof. When the Amir Shere Ali died, the
country was again thrown into complete disorder.
From Samarkand Abdur Rahman went into
Afghanistan, and endeavoured to enlist the sympathies
and obtain the assistance of some of the
tribes in his attempts to gain the throne; he
also tried hard to obtain our support. But it
was the British who gave him assistance, and,
whether for good or evil, he remembered this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fact during the whole of his reign, and was our
enemy. In 1877â79 we might easily have converted
Afghanistan into a friendly âbuffer Stateâ
between us and India, but in spite of General
Kaufmannâs representations we failed to seize
the psychological moment, and the âbufferâ
subsequently created by Great Britain was one
hostile to us. Thanks to this short-sighted policy
of ours with regard to this country, we lost
prestige in Central Asia for some time, and
numerous English emissaries charged with the
task of stirring up the warlike Turkomans against
us penetrated into the steppes of Turkestan.
Raids by Turkomans into our territory on the
eastern shores of the Caspian became more
frequent and more daring, eventually reaching
even as far as Krasnovodsk. We could no longer
hold our hand, and decided to send an expedition
into the steppes to seize Geok Tepe. The
failure of the first expedition under Lomakin,
and the heavy losses suffered at Geok Tepe
under General Skobeleff, were signs that we
might expect serious trouble in Central Asia,
and would therefore have to increase our garrisons
there, and alsoâwhich was more importantâto
improve the communications with Russia.
The example of what happened to the Italians
in Abyssinia showed what even pastoral tribes,
if patriotic and well led, can do against European
regular troops. It became increasingly clear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to leave our districts in Central Asia, 1,335 miles
by road from OrenburgâRussiaâs outpostâwith
such small garrisons as they then had, was, under
the then complicated conditions, to court disaster.
We therefore began the construction of the
Central Asian railway system, which reached
completion only two years ago.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> These lines
cost a large sum, which had to be provided at
the expense of our preparations on the western
frontier and in the Far East; but the wisdom of
our action was amply proved in 1885 during the
frontier trouble, ending in the defeat of the
Afghan troops at Kushk.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> After negotiations
with Great Britain, which at some periods became
almost critical, a <i>modus vivendi</i> was reached, and
our present frontier with Afghanistan, delimitated
by a special mixed Boundary Commission,
has not been violated for the twenty years of its
existence. I repeat that it is my firm conviction
that this frontier is in every way satisfactory
to us, and to alter it by advancing to Herat<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
would in no way be beneficial. The period of
small expeditions, always ending in some slight
increase to our territory, ceased with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
delimitation of this frontier. Of the two nations
who now march with us in Central Asiaâthe
Persians and the Afghansâthe latter possesses
such large armed forces that we should need a
considerable army to carry out any advance into
their country, irrespective of any assistance that
might be given to them by Great Britain. On
the other hand, the defence of our own extensive
territory has become a very difficult matter,
chiefly owing to the spread of the Pan-Slav<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
propaganda, and were the Afghans to attempt an
invasion on the pretext of liberating our subject
races, partial risings of the population are quite
possible. We must, therefore, maintain sufficient
troops in those regions, not only in case of war,
but also to prevent internal trouble. In this
way our position in Central Asia has become
more complicated during the last forty yearsâin
fact, ever since we took Tashkent. Now, instead
of the five or six battalions with which we conquered
the country, we have two whole army
corps in Turkestan.</p>

<p>Just as had been the case when the Emperor
Alexander II. came to the throne, a great effort in
the direction of military economy was made after
the accession of Alexander III., and the army
was reduced by 28,000 men; but the conclusion
of the Triple Affiance and the rapid growth of
our neighboursâ armaments brought about a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
increase in the army, as well as a <i>rapprochement</i>
between ourselves and France, who was equally
menaced. To the creation of new units by
Germany and Austria we replied by raising
fresh troops or by transferring men from the
Caucasus and the interior to the western frontier.
In this severe race of preparation for war we
were unable to keep up with our western neighbours,
not so much in point of mere numbers as
in necessary organization. We were too poor
and too backward, for modern mobilization
entails heavy drafts upon the whole reserve
forces of a State, and is deeply felt by the whole
nation. This is what that distinguished German
writer, Von der Goltz, implied when he wrote
that modern wars must be waged by armed
nations, not by armies. Other things being
equal, success is assured to the side which can
quickest concentrate superior numbers in the
field. These forces must not only be under
competent leaders, but must be well supplied,
reinforced, and equipped. It was chiefly in this
respect that we soon felt our inferiority. By
forming cadres without any strength, or with a
very small strength, we are able, thanks to our
large population, our numerous reserves and
militia, to mobilize an immense number of troops
of sortsâregulars, reservists, reserve units, and
militia. But owing to the shortage of officers
and lack of supplies, these units would vary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
much in their value for war. While our advanced
troops only could be concentrated as quickly as
those of our neighbours, the reserve troops could
be mobilized but slowly, the reserve units would
be quite inadequate, and, finally, the militia would
not be embodied at the same time as the others,
and even then only with great difficulty. But
though we had plenty of men and horses, <i>matÃ©riel</i>âparticularly
technical storesâwas insufficient
(telegraphs, telephones, balloons, pigeon post,
light railways, explosives, tools, wire, etc.).
Owing to the constant advances in scientific
knowledge, and to the continual demands made
for increased strength in construction, fortresses
are no sooner built than the whole of their
masonry has to be remodelled. We could not,
therefore, keep our armaments and defences up
to date, and they were largely obsolete. Though
our siege artillery had received a certain number
of good and modern guns, it was not equal to
our neighboursâ in mobility, and we did not possess
nearly enough technical troops, such as sappers,
and mining and railway companies. There was
no organization either for peace or war of the
auxiliary services for the line of communications;
the depÃ´t troops it was proposed to form would
not have been sufficient; and there were no
means of keeping up the numbers of officers and
doctors. But our greatest danger lay in the
inferiority of our railways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>After 1882 we made great advances in efficiency,
but only arrived at such a point that we were able
to carry out a concentration on the frontier in
double the time it would have taken our neighbours,
so that not only were we condemned to the
defensive, but our forces coming up in succession
would be destroyed in detail. Since the lesson
of 1870â71, we had become reconciled to the
fact that we should never be able to catch up
Germany in speed of mobilization, but we had
flattered ourselves that in this respect we were
ahead of Austria. Some ten or eleven years ago
we were undeceived on this point also. The
Austrian War Department had succeeded in
working wonders in preparing the probable area
of operations on our side for both attack and
defence, and, owing to the many strategic lines
of rail constructed through the Carpathians, this
range had ceased to be a dangerous obstacle in
rear of their advanced position.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Besides the
sums allotted for the ordinary expenditure on
the army, both the Austrians and the Germans
had had recourse to extraordinary and special
grants; thus their storehouses were filled, their
fortresses well built and equipped, and their roads
constructed. Not only did our lack of funds
handicap us in these directions, but our backward
state of development proved an insuperable bar,
especially as regards the construction of railways.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
With our neighbours, the directions in which
strategic lines of rail were required coincided
generally with their economic alignment. With
us the two requirements were at variance, and
each strategic line proposed on our side met with
the opposition of the Finance Department as
being economically unsound.</p>

<p>In the Far East we had little trouble for many
years. Though our frontier with China was
6,000 miles long, it was not till 1880âtwenty-seven
years agoâthat the increase in Japanâs
military power and the awakening of China
compelled us to think about strengthening our
position in that quarter.</p>

<p>In 1871, when the western provinces of China<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
were convulsed by the Mohammedan rebellion,
we occupied the province of Kuldja in order to
safeguard our own borders. The inhabitantsâthe
Dunganites and Taranchitesâwho had
previously completely defeated the Chinese and
some of the Kalmuits, gave us very little trouble,
and laid down their arms on our definite promise
to make them Russian subjects. But while our
soldiers were doing their work on the spot, our
diplomats in their offices miles away, without
consulting any of those with local knowledge,
such as Kaufmann or Kolpakovski, thought fit
to promise the Chinese that as soon as they
quelled the revolt and arrived as far as Kuldja,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that province could be restored to them. As a
matter of fact, we hoped, of course, that they
would be unable to defeat Yakub Beg, and so
would never gain possession of Kashgaria, and
yet we were helping them towards this very
object. The position was a curious one, and in
1876, when I, as Russian envoy, was in Yakub
Begâs camp near Kurlia<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> negotiating as to the
delimitation of the boundary of Fergana, just
conquered by us, he himself remarked on it. He
very justly reproached me with the fact that
while I was dealing with him, another officer of
the General Staff, one Lieutenant-Colonel
Sosnovski, was, with the knowledge of the
Russian authorities, supplying the Chinese troops
moving against him. His statement was absolutely
correct. After Yakub Begâs sudden death
the Chinese quickly got possession of the whole
of Kashgaria, advanced up to the southern edge
of Kuldja, and asserted their rights to that
province also. While Kaufmann urged most
strenuously that we ought not to return the
province to them, we procrastinated. In 1878,
when I was at the head of the Asiatic Section of
the General Staff, I put a memorandum before
my Chief, Count Heyden, in which I pointed out
the great strategic value of Kuldja to us. I also
stated that, if we felt bound by our loosely given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
engagement to return this province to China, we
should most certainly be justified in demanding
compensation for the expenses incurred by us
during our eight yearsâ occupation. I suggested
a sum of Â£10,000,000 in gold, as being suitable
and also opportune for the construction of the
Siberian Railway. My contention was supported
by Kaufmann, but our diplomatists were against
it. A special committee, consisting of M. Giers,
Minister for Foreign Affairs; Admiral Grieg,
Minister of Finance; Generals Kaufmann,
Obrucheff, and myself, under the presidency of
Count Milutin, was appointed to go into the
question by the Emperor Alexander II. M.
Giers and Admiral Grieg were in favour of
returning Kuldja to China without demanding
any compensation. Admiral Grieg asserted that
Russia was in no particular need of money, and
both Ministers held that we were bound by the
promise to Chinaâa promise lightly made by
our diplomats without the knowledge of the men
on the spotâwhile the other engagement made
with the Dunganites and Taranchites in 1871
could be forgotten. After prolonged discussions,
it was decided to return Kuldja to China, and to
ask for Â£500,000 as compensation. The member
who was most opposed to obtaining a large sum
of money from China was, of all people, the
Finance Minister; he apparently overlooked the
possibility that would be conferred by this sum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of carrying out the construction of the Siberian
Railway ten years sooner. For this oversight we
paid later. Meanwhile the Chinese assumed a
stiff attitude, and threatened to seize Kuldja,
moving troops towards it to Urumchi, Manas,
Kunia-Turfan, and other points. We, in reply,
hastily strengthened our position by sending up
troops from Tashkent towards Kuldja. In 1880
we fortified the Barokhorinski ridge, separating
it from parts of Chinese Turkestan in the occupation
of the Chinese. I was in command of our
advanced guard, and saw how gladly our troops
would have obeyed the order to advance. They
were disgusted at the thought of having to
abandon the splendid country of which we had
been in occupation for nearly ten years, and at
the idea of breaking faith with the people to
whom we had promised protection, who were
even then crowding round our camps in alarm at
the rumour that we were going to hand them
over to the Chinese. Of course, at the time this
question was decided we entertained a very
exaggerated idea of the value of the Chinese
troops themselves, and also of Chinaâs military
resources.</p>

<p>Events afterwards moved rapidly. We commenced
the construction of the railway through
Manchuria, and occupied the Kuan-tung Peninsula,
thus alarming not only China, but Japan.</p>

<p>Thus, during the last quarter of the nineteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
century matters became more involved on all
sides. Not only did we have to meet the
preparations of Austria and Germany on the
west, and threatened trouble in our frontier
districts near Roumania, Turkey, and Afghanistan,
but from 1896 to 1900 we had, in addition,
to face the problem of safeguarding the position
we had suddenlyâand, for the War Department,
unexpectedlyâtaken up in the Far East in our
advance to the Pacific Ocean. The magnitude
of the task of protecting 11,000 miles of frontier,
and of keeping up forces so as to be in a position
to fight different combinations of no less than
nine adjacent States, conveys some idea of the
colossal expense involved.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="capsub">Deductions drawn from the work of the army in the past
200 years, which may serve as some guide for the
line our military policy should take in the beginning
of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class="noindent">During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
the energies of the country were mainly absorbed
in expansion and consolidation. In the prosecution
of these objects we were engaged in many
wars, and the experience thereby gained should
help to indicate what is in store for the War
Department in the future. The following appear
to be the principal deductions that can be drawn
from the past:</p>

<p>1. The duties in connection with our movement
towards the shores of the Baltic and Black
Seas, the expansion of Russian territory to the
west (White Russia, Little Russia, Poland), to
the south (Caucasus), to the east (Central Asia),
were carried out by the army. From the analysis
of our frontiers already made in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>, it
will be seen that, thanks to what has been done,
<i>Russia is in no need of any further increase of
territory. This conclusion is in the highest degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
important and satisfactory. At the same time,
our military position does not now compare so
favourably as formerly with that of our neighbours,
principally owing to our lack of railways,
and our western frontiers are exposed to great
danger through the perfect state of preparation of
Germany and Austria.</i></p>

<p>2. For only seventy-two years in the preceding
two centuries did we enjoy peace; during the
remaining time Russia was engaged in thirty-three
external and two internal wars. On an
average, therefore, wars occurred every six years.
They were particularly frequent during the first
half of the nineteenth century, while in the latter
portion, if the campaigns in the Caucasus and in
Asia be excepted, we were only twice engaged
in hostilitiesâin 1853â55 and in 1877â78. We
entered the present century after twenty-two
yearsâ continuous peace, a longer interval than
had occurred for 200 years; but during this time
many possible causes for hostilities had arisen
on all sides. Not only had the Empire become
oppressed with the burden of armed peace, but
the strain was so tense that there were grounds
for fearing lest âguns should begin to shoot of
their own accord.â The commencement of each
of the three past centuries are full enough of sad
memories for Russia; it might, therefore, have
been expected, taking into consideration the
military forces which were straining at the leash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that the beginning of the twentieth century
would not be free from war clouds. It only
needed a spark on one part of the frontier to
kindle conflagration everywhere. Serious potential
causes for hostilities existed on the western,
Turkish, and Afghan frontiers, and in 1895 there
was an actual <i>casus belli</i> on the Chinese border. In
such circumstances international affairs required
the most delicate handling, in order to avoid
creating any additional excuses for war.</p>

<p>3. If the Caucasus be excluded, we were
engaged on our own soil in only six campaigns,
lasting for six and a half years, out of all the
struggles during this period, the remainder being
waged beyond our frontiers. This conferred great
advantages on us, and showed the high state of
our preparation in those days as compared with
that of our enemies. The offensive has such
immense advantage over the defensive that we
should always strive, by being as ready as our
neighbours, to be in a position to attack.</p>

<p>4. In the twenty-six battles of the nineteenth
century, the casualties out of 1,500,000 combatants
amounted to 323,000â<i>i.e.</i>, almost 22 per
cent. The heaviest were at Austerlitzâ21,000
out of 75,000 engaged; at Borodinoâ40,000 out
of 120,000 engaged; and at Sevastopolâ85,000
out of 235,000 engaged. The following table
shows our total losses in the two centuries:</p>

</table>


<p>While the numbers engaged, therefore, were
practically the same in both centuries, the losses
in killed and wounded in the nineteenth were
almost double those in the eighteenth; this
indicates the more deadly character of war in the
former period, and shows also that the losses
became greater as weapons became perfected.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
If we assume that Russia will probably have to
put the same number of men in the field in the
twentieth century as in the past, and that the
growth of casualties will be in the same proportion,
we must be prepared to face losses amounting
to 2,000,000 killed and woundedâ<i>i.e.</i>, 40 per
cent. of those engaged.</p>

<p>5. To keep pace with our neighboursâ continually
improving preparation, there is no doubt
Russia will be compelled to increase her war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
establishment. In our victorious combat with
Turkey in 1827â29, the greatest strength to
which our army ever rose in one campaign was
155,000 men, while in 1877â78 the highest figure
reached was 850,000. Our maximum in the
Prussian War of 1756â62 was only 130,000. I
am thankful to say we have lived at peace
with our western neighbour for 150 years; but
if we were to fight in the west without allies
now, ten times that number would be insufficient
to defeat the German army, andâwhat is the
main thingâcrush the patriotism of the armed
nation behind it. It follows, therefore, that we
must not only be prepared in the present century
to take the field with forces that are huge in
comparison with those of former days, but also to
face the colossal initial expenditure and recurrent
cost demanded by their creation and maintenance.</p>

<p>6. In the eighteenth and in the first half of the
nineteenth century our army was a long-service
one, formed on the European model, well armed,
and in spite of its lack of training, quite equal
to the forces of Sweden, France, or Prussia,
while we were superior in organization, armament,
and training to our chief foeâTurkey.
About the middle of the last century we began
to fall behind the western nations in equipment
and in all the technical means of destruction.
At the battle of Borodino our firearms were not
inferior to those of the French, but at Sevastopol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
we had only smooth-bore muskets, excellent for
making a noise, for performing rifle exercises or
bayonet fighting, but inaccurate, and of short
range.</p>

<p>7. It became only too clear during our last
warsâin 1853â55 and 1877â78âthat many of
our senior officers were unfit for their work
under modern and complicated conditions. The
juniors were brave and active within the limits
of their duties, but insufficiently educated.
Officers commanding units were, with some
brilliant exceptions, quite incapable of making
the most out of the fighting qualities of their
troops; but weakest of all were our generalsâour
brigade, division, and army corps commanders.
The majority were incapable of commanding
all three arms in action, and knew
neither how to insure cohesion among the units
under them, nor to keep touch with the forces
on either side. The feeling of mutual support
was therefore with us quite undeveloped. Indeed,
it often happened that while one of our
forces was being destroyed, the commander of
some other force close by remained inactive
under the plea of not having received any orders.</p>

<p>8. Generally speaking, at the time of the
Crimea and Turkish War (of 1877â78) our
troops had practically no tactical training, and
we did not know how to attain the best results
with the minimum of loss. In the attack we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
advanced almost in column, and suffered heavily;
while very little use was ever made of the
auxiliary armsâcavalry, artillery, and sappersâindeed,
they were almost forgotten. But we
had one strong point: we were not afraid to die,
and only asked to be shown in which direction
sacrifice was required of us.</p>

<p>9. Judging by the experiences of the wars of
these two centuries, in order to insure success in
the future we must be prepared to concentrate a
superior force. Without superiority in numbers
our troops were unable, especially in the attack,
to defeat Swedes, Frenchmen, or, in the last
war, Turks.</p>

<p>10. But, quite apart from the grave question
of how best to make ready to oppose the armies
of our western neighbours, 2 millions strong, the
War Department has to take into account the
40,000,000 of non-Russian subjects, many of
whom live in our Asiatic frontier districts and
in the Caucasus, for their attitude really determines
the number of men we must leave for the
defence of those frontiers in case of a European
war.</p>

<p>11. Finally, the work of the Department became
still more complicated in the concluding
years of the last century, owing to the greater
frequency of the calls upon the troops to take
part in the suppression of civil disorder in Russia
itself. The discontent of all grades of the population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
has increased of recent years, and revolutionary
propaganda have found in this dissatisfaction
their most favourable soil; even the
army has not escaped infection. It therefore
appears that the maintenance of order in the
interior of our country will not be the smallest
task of the War Department in the coming
century.</p>

<p>12. In the last twenty-five years not only
Germany and Austria, but our other neighbours,
have perfected the organization of their forces,
and have arrived at a pitch of excellence which
will enable them either to take up a strong
defensive, or rapidly to carry the war into our
territory; consequently, we have to face greater
expenditure, and arrange for larger concentrations
also on the Roumanian, Turkish, and
Afghan frontiers. We were at peace for nearly
two hundred years on the Chinese border, but
events occurred within the last fifteen years of
the last century which forced us to begin increasing
our insignificant forces then in the Far
East, although we quite realized that our best
policy was to keep peace with China, and to
avoid rupture with Japan. <i>Thus the chief duty
of the War Department in the first years of the
present century is the defence of our frontiers.
Of these, our Austrian and German borders,
being the most dangerous, should receive our
particular attention.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that to carry on an energetic
offensive is our best protection. But our
power to do this does not depend upon the action
of our War Department alone: it depends upon
the relative national efficiencies. The more fully
developed and efficient a nation is, the more
numerous are its war resources of every sort.
But the one factor which nowadays determines
more than all else the nature and direction of
operations is the railways. In this connection
we have noted the large number of lines at the
disposal of our neighbours in the west, and that
is precisely the front upon which we are handicapped
almost to actual impotence by our backwardness.
There are so many other urgent calls
for the expenditure of money that the construction
of purely strategic and economically
unremunerative lines seems wasteful and the
cost prohibitive. For this reason our strategy
on this side calls for the greatest care and thought
in order that we may conduct as active a defence
as possible. The next thing to do after admitting
our present disadvantages is to realize that
it is upon this frontier that the largest portion
of the funds available for military purposes
should be spent, while the remainder can be
apportioned between all our other frontiers. It
is clear that we were in no position to spend
money on the Far East, and after the forward
moves made in that direction from 1896â1900, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
was realized that in that quarter the purely
defensive was our best policy. The <i>communiquÃ©</i>
of our Government of June 24, 1900, informed
the whole world of our intention not to annex
the territory we were then occupying in Manchuria,
and gave us every reason to suppose that
if we kept our engagements no trouble with
China and Japan was likely.</p>

<p>13. Even in the concluding years of the last
century Russia was not preparing for any further
advance in the Far East, but was fully occupied
with the defence of her western front and with
the maintenance of internal order. Thus, our
unexpected forward movement, first in Manchuria
and then to the shores of the Pacific
Ocean, found the War Department as surprised
as it was unprepared. In such circumstances
our promise not to annex Manchuria was a very
necessary one, not only on account of our desire
not to disturb our friendly relations with China,
but because we were aware of our military
unreadiness in that part of the world. In the
report I submitted in 1900 regarding the duties
of the Department in the early future, I said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âWhile we must be prepared to defend our
interests upon the Pacific Ocean, in Afghanistan,
Persia, and Turkey, and also to fight at sea, we
cannot afford either the men or the money to be
at the same time equal in power to our western
neighbours. We have given to Germany and
Austria a decided advantage by directing our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
attention to the Far East. This disturbance of
the balance of power menaces the integrity of
the Empire, and I sincerely believe that it will
not be permitted to continue by the Tsar. As
the War Departmentâs first task, therefore, I
propose to develop the efficiency of our forces
on the western frontier, and to formulate a
definite plan of operations for them.â</p></div>

<p>From our Allyâs point of view, also, it was
only right to attend to this at once, for our
comparative weakness on this side would in case
of war allow the Powers of the Triple Alliance
to contain us with quite a small force on our
frontier and to crush France by overwhelming
numbers.</p>

<p>14. Our land forces bore the brunt of the
national struggles during this period. After
Peter the Greatâs time the rÃ´le of the Russian
fleet in all the wars in which we were engaged
was insignificant. In the last two great wars of
the last century we particularly needed the
co-operation of the fleet, but our sailors at
Sevastopol fought on land, owing to our naval
inefficiency. In the war of 1877â78 the Turks had
no fleet on the Black Sea. Russia is undoubtedly
a land Power; the small part played in the past
by the fleet, therefore, was not accidental, but
natural. If we had spent large sums in this
period on our navy, we should only have made
our position worse, for it was only by immense
expenditure on the army that we were able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
win. History has taught us that we should
follow in our fathersâ footsteps, and, considering
the army as Russiaâs right arm, spend upon it
the larger part of the sums allotted by the
Ministry of Finance for general military needs.
But our active ventures in the Far East forced
us into naval expenditure, which was arranged
for in the last years of last century by starving
the army finances. The result is alarming. On
this point I wrote in my report of 1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âIf in the future the fleet is to be increased
at the expense of the army, and if the increase
of our forces on the eastern frontier is to be
made at the expense of those stationed on the
western, then our already weak position in regard
to Germany and Austria will become still worse.
With the growth of our navy will arise questions
of coaling stations and ports, and as our expenditure
on these as well as on our ships grows
heavier, it will entail retrenchment on our most
important frontierâthat in Europe. Once our
fleet had destroyed the Turkish sailing fleet at
Sinope, it became impotent, despite its high
<i>moral</i>, for it then had to contend against steam,
against which it was powerless.â</p></div>

<p>15. In the war of 1877â78 we had an unfortunate
experience. The Turks, whom we had
conquered previously, although we had to fight
against huge odds, were on this occasion
organized on the European system by European
instructors, and were better armed than we were.
Their firearms had been made in the workshops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of Germany and England, and were far superior
to ours.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Now, other conditions being equal,
not only does the better weapon tend to victory,
because it causes greater loss, but becauseâand
this is far more importantâthe knowledge of
being better armed bestows confidence. Possessed
of a weapon even but little inferior to
that of an enemy, men are inclined to ascribe
their own faults to the superiority of the enemyâs
armament. There was in this respect no such
difference between us and the Turks in 1877â78
as had existed in 1853â55; but still, after our
first misfortune at Plevna, our army lost confidence
in its rifles and guns, and ascribed its
misfortunes to the superior armament of the
Turks. Everything, therefore, points to the
necessity of keeping up to date in armament.
In the past our difficulty in keeping pace with
the various improvements so rapidly introduced
was increased by the fact that we not only had
to re-arm the regular army, but had to create
an immense stock of weapons for the reserve
troops, militia, depÃ´t troops, and again as a
reserve for the whole of the forces.</p>

<p>16. In our wars with minor enemies (such as
Turks, Caucasians, and Central Asians) we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
were victorious, owing to our great numerical
superiority. In meeting nations of a higher
civilization than our own (such as the Swedes
and the French), we generally suffered very
heavily at first, but won in the end, in spite of
our comparative lack of skill, owing to our
dogged bravery and determination. Peter the
Great carried on the struggle for nine years
from Narva to Poltava, and Alexander I. fought
for the same period between Austerlitz and the
entry of our troops into Paris. The objects of
these wars were clear to our troops, and the men
were inspired to fight on to the end at all costs.
As a result, our troops did win. In the Crimea,
and in 1877â78, not only was our object in
fighting vague, but the wars were prematurely
finished before the army or the nation had really
put out their strength, and in spite of our
sacrifices and losses, we were in both cases unsuccessful.
Every war brings in its train much
unhappiness to both sides, and the loss of a
campaign is for a great nation a supreme misfortune
and one overwhelming the machinery of
government. Therefore, strive as it may against
commencing hostilities, when once a country
takes up arms it should continue to fight until
it wins; otherwise it will lose the right to be
considered a great nation, and will become a
âcollection of mere ethnographical material,â from
which other nationalities may be strengthened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The following words of my report of 1900 are
as applicable to-day as when I wrote them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âCrises of world-wide importance arise suddenly,
and are not prevented by the unpreparedness
of a nation for war. On the contrary, the
knowledge of unreadiness in any quarter only
leads to a desire to take advantage of it in others.
Therefore a struggle such as has never been seen
in the world may come sooner than we think.
It may burst forth even contrary to the wish of
the Tsar, and against the interests of Russia.
This would be a great calamity for the whole
world. But particularly calamitous for Russia
would be any cessation by her, before complete
victory was achieved, of a war once started.</p>

<p>â<i>In the event of disaster in the first campaign,
and after the first and serious consequences of warâfamine,
disease, paralysis of trade, and, above
all, heavy lossesâhave made themselves felt, the
Russian monarchâs character will need to be of
iron to enable him to resist the universal clamour
that will be raised to accept defeat and make
peace.</i>â</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="capsub">The work before the War Department in the concluding
years of the last, and the early years of the present,
centuryâMoney allotted to it from 1898â1903âInadequacy
of these sums to meet the demandsâMeasures
which it was possible to undertakeâSteps
taken to improve and consolidate our position in the
Far East.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the <i>Russki Invalid</i> (No. 143 of 1895) an
article appeared in reply to one by Demchinski,
which had been published in the <i>Slovo</i> under the
title of âWere we Ready for War?â Demchinski
endeavoured to prove that we spend
more than other countries on national defence;
that the amounts allotted for this purpose in
Russia are ample; that the measures brought
forward as necessary in order to prepare our army
for war are merely a cloak for extortion; and
that lack of financial control in our administration
allows great openings for the misappropriation of
funds. In replying, the article in the <i>Russki
Invalid</i> quoted from the standard works of
Professor Maksheeff upon the army estimates of
Germany and Russia from 1888 to 1900. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
these thirteen years the expenditure amounted to
Â£358,100,000 in Germany, and Â£347,900,000 in
Russia. Therefore Germany, with half our peace
strength, spent in that period Â£10,000,000 more
than we did. The enormous length of our frontiers,
amongst other things, forces us to maintain
twice as many men in peace as Germany. Even
of the lesser sum for greater numbers that we
spend, we are obliged to allot almost the whole
to meet maintenance charges (food, uniform, etc.).
So that not only do we spend less money than
Germany on the whole, but we can afford proportionately
less on âspecial or extraordinary
services,â which include those of preparing the
army for war. On this important question the
writer of the article in the <i>Russki Invalid</i> expresses
himself much to the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âAs the ordinary expenditure is urgent, and
cannot be postponed, it calls for no comment,
being allotted, in fact, to measures to which we
are already committed. With regard to the
measures which come under the head of extraordinary
expenditure, the case is different. They
are not urgent in the sense that we are absolutely
committed to them, and they are, therefore, as a
matter of course, not urgent in the opinion of
those unversed in military matters. Consequently
these persons are inclined to refuse sanction to
such measures, to postpone them, or, under the
most favourable circumstances, to spread their
execution over a considerable period. The result
is bad for national defence and for the preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of the army for war. Our forces might
suddenly be called upon to take the field with
inferior armament, with insufficient and unserviceable
supplies, and without well-organized
communications. Upon analyzing the German
army estimates, one is struck with the comparative
magnitude of the initial and extraordinary expenditure,
which shows that, although her army
is half the strength of ours, she spends vastly
more money on it than we do on ours.â</p></div>

<p>Our comparative unreadiness for war, in spite
of our possessing a large standing army, first
became evident, as I have mentioned, as far back
as 1870, when the Germans were able to throw
an immense army across the French frontier in a
fortnight, and conduct a victorious campaign
with extraordinary speed. The Turkish War of
1877â78, again, exposed our weak points in organization
and mobilization, and profiting by its
lessons, many measures towards improvement
were undertaken during Count Milutinâs rÃ©gime
at the Ministry of War. The new grouping of
the Powers and the formation of the Triple
Alliance, also, were events which emphasized the
necessity for us to set our house in order as
regards defence. During the sixteen years from
1882 to 1898 Generals Vannovski and Obrucheff,
guided by the opinions of the leading generals in
command of troops, managed to increase the
efficiency of the army and at the same time to
strengthen our defences. On the western frontier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
a system of fortified positions was organized, and
reserves of supplies collected at strategic points;
but, owing to the inadequate development of our
railway system, it became necessary, in addition,
to increase the number of troops permanently
stationed in the western military districts. Steps
were also taken for the defence of the Baltic and
Black Sea coasts. But our attention was chiefly,
and quite rightly, confined to the west, and as
small appropriations as possible were made for
the Caucasus, Turkestan, and the Siberian Military
Districts. Thus, in Siberia, from the Pacific
to the Ural Mountains, we only had a few battalions,
and not a single fortress; nor did we have
any fortified posts in Turkestan. To strengthen
the troops on the western frontier, indeed, we
took troops from the Caucasus, and to find money
for the formation of new units, we had to reduce
the strength of those in Turkestan. This was
done on the supposition that if we were strong
on the German side, no one would attack us in
the Caucasus or in Asia. In other words, our
efforts were concentrated upon the most dangerous
frontier. But even then, taking into consideration
the many wants of the army, the sum
available for our western side, though large, was
insufficient to place us in all respects on a level
with both Germany and Austria. Though great
results were obtained as regards the acceleration
of our mobilization, and some very useful strategic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
lines of railway were constructed, our speed of concentration
could not be compared to that of our
neighbours, with their better-developed railway
systems. However economically the War Ministry
treated those measures which were unessential,
and could therefore be shelved temporarily, progress
with the urgent services was not as rapid as
could be desired. Confronted as it was, therefore,
with many demands of the western frontier still
unsatisfied, the Department, on the whole, could
not but be a convinced opponent of a forward
policy in the Far East, in Afghanistan, or in Persia.
This practically represents the state of affairs and
the feeling of the Department right up to the
outbreak of the Chino-Japanese War in 1894.</p>

<p>In 1898 I succeeded General Vannovski as War
Minister, General Sakharoff taking the place of
General Obrucheff.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We fully recognized the
necessity, when framing the estimates, of pursuing
the same policy as our predecessors, and of placing
first and foremost the improvement of our military
position on the west, but we had by this
time taken steps in the Far East which made it impossible
to confine our expenditure in that quarter
to the small amount of previous years. Events
out there had moved rapidly, and were such as
called for expenditure of men and money in Kuan-tung,
Manchuria, and in the Pri-Amur region.</p>

<p>A schedule is drawn up for the allocation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the expenditure of the sum allotted to the War
Ministry. In this, with the previous consent of
the Finance Branch, the War Minister frames a
general estimate for five years, in which the
services are divided up according as the expenditure
is to be capital or recurring. The estimates
for new and important services entailing initial
expenditure are, after being examined by the
Military Council, scrutinized by a special committee
before being approved. This committee
is presided over by the President of the Department
of State Economy, and the Finance
Minister and the State Comptroller are members.
The final list of measures to be undertaken during
the five-year period are then submitted to the
Tsar for sanction. The exposition of all the
armyâs requirements constitutes one of the most
important duties of the War Minister. Firstly,
all general officers in command of districts<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
submit to the Tsar statements as to their requirements
for the troops under their command, as
well as those for works, such as fortresses, railways,
etc. The heads of the chief departmentsâcommissariat,
artillery, engineers, etc.âdraw up
their estimates as to buildings, mobilization, and
educational requirements, etc. These are classified
according as they demand initial or recurring
expenditure, and many of the more important
items are examined in the Military Council or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
special committees. This was the complicated
procedure necessary in 1897 and 1898 to fix the
total sum required by the War Department during
the five years 1898 to 1903 for the maintenance
of the army and the improvement of its military
efficiency. The very limited amount allotted
during the twenty years preceding this period
had literally been doled out, not according to the
needs of the army, but according to the amount
available in the Treasury; consequently the need
of money had gone on increasing cumulatively,
until in 1898 we were face to face with a situation
which demanded greater sacrifices than ever.</p>

<p>Early in 1898 a general statement had been
drawn up by my predecessorâs orders to show our
urgent requirements. By this it was clear that,
in order to satisfy all our wants, a <i>supplementary</i>
allotment of Â£56,500,000 was absolutely necessary
beyond the sum required for the five-year
schedule. This amount included expenditure
on two items of a very special nature: the re-armament
of the field artillery with quick-firing
guns (Â£9,000,000), and the increase of house
allowances (Â£2,000,000). It must be remembered
that the measures now put forward by General
Vannovski did not even dispose of our many
really important needs, for in his supplementary
statement were included only those things that
could not be postponed, or which had long ago
been sanctioned, but not carried out for want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of funds. Amongst the most important of these
were the following:</p>

<p>1. The improvement of the organization of the
army and increases to its establishment, including
additions to the troops in the Asiatic districts,
especially in Pri-Amur.</p>

<p>2. The betterment of the conditions of service
of all ranks, particularly as to an increase to the
officersâ pay and house allowance, and the introduction
of field kitchens.</p>

<p>3. The augmentation of reserve supplies in the
Pri-Amur and Turkestan districts.</p>

<p>4. An increase in the artillery in the Siberian
Military District.</p>

<p>5. The formation of extra engineer units and
strengthening of fortresses.</p>

<p>The Finance Minister, to whom this demand
for a further allotment of Â£45,500,000<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> additional
to the schedule for the period of 1898 to
1902 was submitted, replied that the state of
the countryâs finances would not permit of the
money being given. After much discussion
he agreed to grant Â£16,000,000 instead of
Â£45,500,000, and this lesser sum was finally
approved. So we actually received for this five-year
period about Â£30,000,000 less than was
required, or a deficit of Â£6,000,000 per annum.
Such a policy could have only one result, that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
placing us further behind our western neighbours
in the military race, as in many directions
it compelled the cessation of work necessary
for the strengthening of our position both on our
European and Asiatic frontiers. Besides this,
large sums were required for the general improvement
of the status of our troops on the
peace establishment. In the first place, in order
to obtain greater efficiency among the senior
officers, it was essential to treat the whole body
of officers in a more liberal spirit, so that zealous
and capable men should be content to remain in
the Service, and not wish to leave; to modernize
and add to the number of our military educational
establishments, so that as large a number of
officers as possible should receive a general training
of a standard equivalent to that given in
the middle-class educational establishments. Our
private soldiers were decidedly worse off than
those of other armies as regards ready-money,
food, dress, and equipment, and the expenditure
required to improve their condition would of
course be heavy. Again, our horses were not of
a sufficiently good class, especially in the Cossack
regiments and the transport. These were only
the most pressing of the armyâs many needs.</p>

<p>Thus the legacy left to me when I assumed
the duty of War Minister on January 1, 1898,
was no pleasing one. The immense needs of the
army were clear at a glance, but not clearer than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the lack of funds wherewith they might be met.
Consequently I had to examine all proposals
most carefully in order to settle which could be
carried out, and which must be indefinitely postponed.
I have already expressed my views on
the importance of our western frontier, but to
carry out what was necessary for our military
position on that side would have absorbed the
whole of the additional Â£16,000,000 allowed on
the supplementary estimate for all purposes during
five years. Meanwhile there was the long list
of almost equally pressing demands for the improvement
in the senior ranks and for the consolidation
of our position in the Far East, etc.
The housing of our troops was in many cases
so extremely bad that it was difficult to train
the men, and this necessitated the construction
of barracks at various stations. Finally, those
services which had been started in the preceding
five years had to be completed, particularly those
touching the organization of reserve units. The
Tsar investigated the relative urgency of these
matters, and approved a scheme for 1899 to
1903, which, with the exception of the reorganization
of the reserve troops and the further
increase to our troops in European Russia, was
carried out completely. The services approved
by the Tsar were noted by the War Ministry.
The following are a few, and show the form in
which they were officially recorded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>1. With a view to possible complications in
the Far East, the Tsar gave orders that our
military position there should be strengthened.</p>

<p>2. The War Ministerâs recommendations as to
the necessity of improving the general conditions
under which officers served, in order to get
greater efficiency among the seniors, were warmly
supported by the Tsar, who issued orders that
the matter should be taken in hand at once.</p>

<p>3. The Tsar was also pleased to order that
the conditions of service of the soldiers should be
made more liberal. Better quarters were to be
constructed, and the issue of a tea ration was to
be gradually introduced.</p>

<p>4. The Tsar was pleased to recognize the
particular importance of the re-armament of the
artillery, and instructed the Minister of Finance
to provide funds for it by a supplementary grant.</p>

<p>The measures carried out by the War Department
from 1899 to 1903 can be described in a
few words:</p>

<p>The Pri-Amur Military District as at present
defined had only been formed in 1883. Its
garrison originally consisted of 12 battalions,
10 squadrons, 2&frac12; Cossack battalions, 5 batteries,
a sapper company, and 1 company of fortress
artillery. Ten years later, in 1894, it had risen
to 20 battalions of infantry. From 1895 we
began to increase the troops in the Far East
with some rapidity. Between 1898 and 1902
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
they were increased by 840 officers, 37,000 men,
and 2,600 horses. Altogether in that period our
forces had grown to 31 battalions, 15 squadrons,
32 guns, 1 sapper battalion, and 3 battalions of
fortress artillery. Moreover, 5 railway battalions
had been formed for work on the Eastern
Chinese Railway, and the Frontier and other
guards had been increased from 8,000 to 25,000.
The general total increase in numbers in the
Pri-Amur district, in Manchuria and in Kuan-tung,
amounted to 60,000 men. The idea of the
scheme of 1899 was to enable us to bring as soon
as possible the establishment of the troops in
these districts of the Far East up to 48 Rifle and
48 reserve battalions, 57 squadrons, 236 guns,
and 3&frac34; sapper battalions, organized in three corps.
Compared with the few battalions in Siberia
and the Pri-Amur district only a short time
before, this was a large force, and its organization
at so great a distance was most difficult. It
depended to a great extent on the amount of
money available and local conditions, and took
some years to complete. As this force could be
rapidly concentrated, the idea was that it should
constitute a strong advance-guard, under cover
of which the reinforcements from Russia would
be able to concentrate. The fate of a first campaign
must obviously depend to a great extent
on the rapidity with which these reinforcements
could be transported, and yet in 1900 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Siberian Railway was not constructed as a first-class
line, and the Eastern Chinese line was not
finished. I reported in 1900:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âTo bring our forces up to the total specified<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
will take six to seven years. This fact, coupled
with the incapacity of our railways to cope with
any heavy traffic, calls for the greatest care in
our external relations, lest we permit ourselves
to be drawn into war at a disadvantage, with
an insufficient number of troops which could be
only very slowly concentrated.â</p></div>

<p>For various reasons, too complicated to explain,
this advice was not acted on; the necessity
for extreme care was not appreciated, and we
were suddenly plunged into war when we were
not ready. In 1902 our military position was
good, and having begun to carry out our
promises as to the evacuation of Manchuria,
we had every reason to count on a continuance
of peace in the Far East. But towards the end
of that year there were signs of a possible rupture
with Japan. The War Department was
not blind to these, and the measures enumerated
above, which, with the money then available,
were to have been completed by 1906 or 1907,
were, by the aid of a supplementary allotment,
carried out within a year.</p>

<p>While hoping for peace, we steadily prepared
for hostilities, and increased our troops in the
Far East in 1903 by 38 battalions, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
same year formed 32 new battalions in European
Russia; so that by adding one to each of the
East Siberian two-battalion<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> regiments, and
thereby converting them into three-battalion
regiments, all the 9 East Siberian Brigades could
be expanded into 9 East Siberian Rifle Divisions,
with 12 battalions apiece. The allotment of
artillery and sappers to these divisions was
carried out under a special scheme. Thus the
force of 19 battalions which we had in the
Pri-Amur district at the time of the Chino-Japanese
War should have swollen in 1903 into
one of 108 rifle and 20 reserve battalions.
Behind these stood 40 more reserve battalions,
held in reserve in the Siberian Military District.
Altogether our Siberian possessions were to have
contained in 1903 an army of 168 battalions of
infantry, with a due proportion of other arms.
The railway, however, did not permit us to
transport these additional units until the spring
of 1904, when hostilities had commenced. Yet
they were eventually received, and the force in
the Pri-Amurâwhich was practically defenceless
at the time of the Chino-Japanese Warâhad
grown into an army of four Siberian corps and
two independent divisions, which received the
first blows in the Japanese War. Though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
hastily improvised between 1895 and 1903,
thanks to the great efforts made to render them
reliable, to the fortunate selection of their commanders,
and to their strong peace establishments,
they proved to be our best troops. The
principle upon which they were formed was the
transference to them of complete companies
chosen by ballot from the corps in Europe, and
only under exceptional circumstances were the
company officers permitted to be transferred
from these new units. Each of the 32 battalions
was formed from one of the army corps in
Russia, one company being taken from each
brigade, and picked officers were placed in command
of each battalion. The soundness of the
scheme upon which these units were created is
borne out by the fact that at the Ya-lu the
3rd Battalions of the 11th and 12th Regiments,
which had only just arrived to join their regiments,
fought most gallantly. The 3rd Battalion
of the 11th Regiment in particular, by
making a counter-attack with the bayonet, inflicted
severe loss on the enemy. In the spring
of 1905 the regiments of all 7 East Siberian
Rifle Divisions were turned into four-battalion
regiments. In the 1st Manchurian Army, which
I had the honour to command, were 5 of
these East Siberian Rifle Divisions, and their
90<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> battalions were acknowledged to be the pick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of all three armies. But to form all these new
units we had to denude our German frontier to
an alarming extent.</p>

<p>Besides increasing the number of men in the
Far East between 1896 and 1903, we formed
supply depÃ´ts, and hastily fortified Vladivostok
and Port Arthur. Indeed, one quarter of the
total sum allotted to all our fortress construction
and maintenance from 1898 to 1902 was spent
upon these two fortresses. Only on Kronstadt,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
of all our land and sea strongholds, was more
money spent than on Port Arthur. Many other
difficulties besides those of finance confronted us
in the provision of armament. It was vitally
necessary that both Vladivostok and Port
Arthur should have coast guns of the latest
pattern, but it took a long time to get them
delivered by the factories owing to the heavy
orders already being executed for the Navy
Department. As a temporary measure we were
obliged to mount old-pattern guns. In a short
time more than 1,000 pieces of ordnance were
transported from European Russia to these two
places. Progress was greatly delayed when the
railway was interrupted during the rising in
Manchuria in 1900, while work at Port Arthur
itself was for a long time stopped by Admiral
Alexeieffâs order. Had it not been for these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
delays, the place would have been much better
prepared in 1904 than it was. But to appreciate
properly what was accomplished there in a short
time two circumstances should be remembered:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Owing to our fleet being shut up in Port
Arthur, the Japanese possessed the command of
the sea, and were able to remove the armament
from several of their naval fortresses to Kuan-tung
for the siege operations; against these coast
guns even masonry defences were of little use.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> The delivery of these heavy howitzers and
the landing of other siege material was greatly
facilitated by the existence of Dalny, a place
which had been created entirely at the instance of
M. de Witte, without any reference having been
made to the War Ministry or the officer commanding
the Kuan-tung district, under whose
control the locality actually was.</p>

<p>A large quantity of food-supplies was collected
in Port Arthur, and even at the time of its
premature surrender there was enough in the
place to last for one and a half months. Moreover,
the authorities on the spot were empowered
to purchase locally, and as the resources
of flour, barley, rice, and cattle in the district
were unlimited, there was nothing to prevent
them doing this. Many unreasonable reproaches
have been hurled upon the War Department on
account of the inadequate strength of the fortifications,
but in the creation of this fortress great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
difficulties had to be overcome in a very short
time. In estimating the ultimate strength of
the place, it must not be forgotten that we only
took possession of it at the end of 1897; that
during 1898 and 1899 we had a very weak
temporary armament on the sea-front; and that
the cumbrous official procedure then in force
made it impossible to spend quickly large sums
on new fortress works. Firstly, the scheme had
to be drawn up by the engineers on the spot,
then it had to be sent to St. Petersburg to be
examined by the Engineer Committee, and
afterwards to be approved by the Tsar. In the
case of Port Arthur, in order to accelerate this
routine, special authority was deputed to the
local authorities; while Major-General Velichko,
a gifted and energetic Engineer officer, was sent
to the Far East as the representative of the Headquarter
Engineer Administration. Indeed, when
the scheme of fortifications at Port Arthur was
put before the Emperor for his approval, a large
portion of the works had, contrary to the usual
procedure, been commenced in anticipation of
sanction. As everything was stopped by Admiral
Alexeieff, who was commanding the Kuan-tung
district, during the rising in Manchuria in 1900,
we only had three years (1901, 1902, and 1903)
to finish these tremendous permanent works.
Considering the time available and the rocky soil,
much indeed was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The armament, also, could not well have been
provided more quickly. The ordnance had first
to be made, and the orders for coast guns could
only be executed slowly, as the Obukhoff factory
was full of work for the Navy Department. The
10-inch and 11-inch Canet guns and large-calibre
mortars ordered by the War Department were
required simultaneously in all the Russian naval
fortresses, especially in Libau, Kronstadt, and
Vladivostok; but, as a matter of fact, Port
Arthur and Vladivostok received most of them
at the expense of our strength in the Baltic and
Black Seas. While awaiting the demands for
new ordnance to be complied with, we robbed
other places, so as to bring up the Port Arthur
armament to some hundreds of guns. In the
first years of its occupation, also, everything
for this place had to be sent round by sea.
Notwithstanding all these difficulties, in four
years (1899 to 1903) we succeeded in making
Port Arthur so strong that the armament of its
sea-front kept the whole Japanese fleet at a
respectful distance, while the batteries on the
land side withstood a severe test under the most
unfavourable conditions. Not only were the
enemy numerous and possessed of technical
troops and material for the destruction of our
defences, but being presented with a ready-made
base in Dalny, they were able to land
monster siege-guns. Once again, as at Sevastopol,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
our fleet was more useful on land than
on its proper element. Yet the enemy lost twice
as many men as the garrison, and Port Arthur
held out almost twelve months from the commencement
of the war. Even then its fall was
premature.</p>

<p>Much attention was also paid to economy, and
Treasury interests were by no means overlooked.
The rapid concentration of troops, the
large number of buildings that had to be constructed
and the collection of supplies and
stores for the commissariat and engineer departments,
afforded ample scope for malpractices;
but the appointment of selected officers at the
head of these two great branches of the army,
and of picked men as their assistants, was naturally
productive of good results, and the reputation
of these branches in no way suffered in
the war.</p>

<p>I am confident that if future historians take
into consideration the enormous distance of the
theatre of war from the centre of Russia, they
will not only be amazed at the results achieved
by the War Department in strengthening our
position there between the years 1895 and 1903,
but will see how unfounded was the accusation
that adequate steps were not taken to prepare
for war. I repeat that, with such money as was
available, and with the limited time at our disposal,
a great and responsible work was accomplished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
so much so that the Pri-Amur district,
which was defenceless in 1895, was in 1903 so
strong that a whole armed nation, in spite of its
own great efforts and the entire uselessness of
our fleet, was unable to touch our territory
anywhere, with the exception of Saghalien. In
1900 I recorded my opinion that the Japanese
would be able, in the event of war, to put into
the field about 400,000 men with 1,100 guns.
Of course, it was not possible for us to pour such
a number of men into Manchuria and Pri-Amur.
This would have necessitated many years, and
the expenditure of millions, as well as the earlier
construction of railway connection with the Far
East.</p>

<p>The extent to which our strength in the Far
East directly depended on railway efficiency is
apparent from the fact that in our schemes of
July, 1903, for the transport of troops, we could
only count on two short military trains per diem.
When instructions were given to carry four
Rifle and one sapper battalions, two batteries, and
1,700 tons of military stores as quickly as possible
to Port Arthur, it was calculated, according to
the mobilization schemes, that it could not be
done in less than twenty-two days, and we
were unable to make use of the full carrying
capacity of the newly built Eastern Chinese line
for six months after the opening of the war. To
improve it an immense amount of work in laying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
sidings and crossings, arranging for water-supply,
ballasting the track, and the construction of
buildings, was necessary. All this implied railing
up a large number of sleepers, rails, building
materials, and rolling-stock; construction trains
were also required. During 1902 and 1903 the
greater the number of troop-trains that ran, the
less was the progress in the construction and
improvement of the line. During the latter
year the War Department took every advantage
of the railway in order to increase our forces in
the Far East, and it was only owing to the
immense exertions of all the railway personnel
that it was possible to transport the troops and
military stores without stopping construction
altogether. Notwithstanding the danger of such
a course, we used the sea for the transport of
troops as well as stores, and the great risk that
we ran in doing so during the second half of
1903, after the viceroyalty had been formed, is
illustrated by the fact that some of the consignments
of preserved meat sent for Port Arthur
fell into the hands of the enemy a few days
before war was declared. It is clear, therefore,
to what extent Bezobrazoffâs project for the rapid
concentration of an army of 75,000 men in
Southern Manchuria [sent to me in the summer
of 1903] could be carried out. The scanty
population and the absence of local resources in
the Pri-Amur prohibited the maintenance of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
large force there in peace-time. Over the wide
stretch of territory from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok
there are only about a million souls, and
of this total only 400,000 are in the Amur and
Maritime districts. From this can be gathered
what an impossible burden to the State it would
have been to attempt to maintain a large army
in such a desert. Consequently we endeavoured
to keep in Siberia and Pri-Amur only such a
number as would be sufficient, in the first
instance, to contain the enemy, and to form a
screen, under cover of which the reinforcements
could be concentrated. The conditions are the
same on the western, Caucasian, and Afghanistan
frontiers: the local troops form, so to speak, an
impenetrable veil, under cover of which the
main forces can be concentrated.</p>

<p>Though this screen consisted, in the Far East,
of 172<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> battalions, of which more than 100 could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
take the field, it was never, of course, intended
that the issue of the war should hang upon their
efforts alone; but our difficulty lay in bringing
up our main forces soon enough, for, as the
enemy could concentrate quicker than we could,
our reinforcements might be destroyed in detail
as they arrived. So poor was the traffic capacity
of the railway that we were neither able to send
drafts to the advanced troops nor to support them
in time with adequate reinforcements. If the
arrangements had been such as I shall detail later
on, we should have had double the number of men
at Liao-yang and Mukden that we did have,
and the issue of the battles must have been
different. But the Ministries of Ways and Communications
and of Finance were unable to carry
out their promises, and our army only succeeded
in concentrating eight months later than it
should have done. By September, 1905, we
were at last able to collect an army 1,000,000
strong, ready in every respect to commence a
second campaign, with troops and material of a
nature to guarantee success. We had received
machine-guns, howitzers, shells, small-arm
ammunition, field railways, wireless telegraphy,
and technical stores of all sorts, and the senior
officers were mostly fresh. The War Department
had, with the co-operation of other departments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
successfully accomplished a most colossal task.
What single military authority would have
admitted a few years ago the possibility of concentrating
an army of a million men 5,400 miles
away from its bases of supply and equipment by
means of a poorly constructed single-line railway?
Wonders were effected, but it was too late.
Affairs in the interior of Russia for which the
War Department could not be held responsible
were the causes of the war being brought to an
end at a time when decisive military operations
should really have only just been beginning.</p>

<p>The re-armament of the artillery was accomplished
as follows. Owing to the introduction of
the quick-firing gun in other armies, we were
compelled to adopt it. The superiority of the
quick-firer over the old pattern was obvious, for,
apart from its greater range and accuracy, each
quick-firing battery, by reason of the greater
number of shells it fires, can cause destruction
equal to that of a much larger number of non-quick-firing
guns. After prolonged and exhaustive
trials of different patterns, amongst
which were those submitted by the French
factories of St. Chamond and Schneider, the
German firm of Krupp, and the Russian Putiloff,
preference was given to the Russian design, and
in the beginning of 1900 the first lot of 1,500 guns
was ordered, further trials being also arranged
for. Not everybody was convinced of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
undoubted superiority of the new type of weapon,
and General Dragomiroff, who had always been
opposed to quick-firing artillery, still remained
a strong opponent of its adoption. In 1902 an
order for a second lot of guns of a modified and
improved pattern was given. To test the weapon
thoroughly and under war conditions, the
2nd Battery of the Guards Rifle Artillery
Division, armed with this new 3-inch quick-firer,
was sent, in August, 1900, to the Far East,
where the Boxer campaign was then in progress.
The division took part in four expeditions, two
in the valley of the Pei-chih-li, one in the hills and
sandy steppes of Mongolia, and one in the hills
of Eastern Manchuria. It covered altogether
about 2,400 miles of different sorts of country,
under variations in temperature of from 35Â° to
22Â° RÃ©aumur. Most of the marches were as much
as forty miles in length. The battery came into
action eleven times, and fired 389 rounds at
cavalry, infantry, buildings, and fortifications at
ranges from point-blank to 2,500 yards. The
results attained were quite satisfactory, particularly
if the arduous nature of the campaign,
the season of the year, and the haste with which
the battery was formed, be taken into account.
Unfortunately, the test of shelling houses and
field works was made against an enemy who
made little resistance, so that faults in the
ammunition which have recently come to light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
were not then discovered. Wishing to have
as simple an equipment as possible, we adopted
one pattern of shell, which was efficient with
time-fuze against troops in the open, and could
be used with percussion-fuze against troops
under cover; but we omitted to take into account
the weakness of the explosive employed as burster.
The projectile which did splendidly against
exposed targets was of little use for destroying
such cover as buildings, timber, or breastworks.
In March, 1902, the necessary grant was made
for re-arming batteries of the 2nd Category,
and the orders were carried out in our arsenals.
The re-armament made such progress that at
the time of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese
War the whole of our artillery, with the exception
of some Siberian batteries, was armed with
quick-firers. At this time a quick-firing mountain-gun
was also invented, which proved very effective.
Generally speaking, the re-armament of
the artillery was quickly and skilfully carried out.</p>

<p>But besides the four points above mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
to which the Tsar was pleased to give his
particular attention, the War Ministry had to
make great efforts in other directions connected
both with the life of the army and its efficiency.
Amongst these tasks was that of improving our
communications by building strategical roads
and railways. These were constructed in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of urgency, according to a special scheme, as
funds became available. Great efforts were
made to push on with both the Bologoe-Siedlce
and Orenberg-Tashkent lines, which were of
particular strategic importance; and in 1899
considerable improvements were carried out in
the Krasnovodsk-Kushk line.</p>

<p>In 1902 we began to consider what would be
required in the five years 1904 to 1909, and in
1903 I submitted to the Finance Minister a
demand for a supplementary grant of Â£82,500,000
in addition to the ordinary Budget for these
five years. He only found it possible to grant
Â£13,000,000. Numerous pressing measures which
had been already postponed in 1899 had again
to be put off with a hope that perhaps in 1910
Russia would be able to find means for the safeguarding
of her most vital interestsâin other
words, for the defence of the Empire.</p>

<p>In submitting his annual report on the War
Ministry in 1904âthe first year of the new five-year
periodâLieutenant-General Rediger, in his
capacity of War Minister and as an acknowledged
authority, made the following true and
important observations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe existing defects in organization and
equipment of our army are the direct result of
the inadequate financial grants made ever since
the war with Turkey. The sum allotted has
never corresponded either to the actual requirements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of the army or to the work it has had to
do, but has been fixed entirely by the amount of
money which seemed available. It has been made
clear, in drawing up the scheme for the coming
five years, that to satisfy only the most pressing
needs a supplementary sum of Â£82,500,000<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> is
required. Only Â£13,000,000 has been allotted.
Thus the estimates for the current five years afford
no hope of improving the existing situation.â</p></div>

<p>Owing to the large requirements of a peace
army of 1,000,000, and the necessity for protecting
frontiers stretching for over 11,000 miles,
the Ministry of Finance had undoubtedly great
difficulty in meeting the demands of the War
Department. The requirements of the navy
were also continually growing, with the result
that less was available for the land forces. But
if the Minister of Finance<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> had confined himself
to his rÃ´le of collector of revenue whereby to
satisfy all the needs of the State, it could never
have been suggested that the money so collected
was spent except in accordance with actual requirements,
for the decision as to which demands
were the most urgent would not have been
within this officialâs province. As a matter of
fact, our finances were managed in so curious
a manner that the Finance Minister was not only
the collector, but also the greatest expender of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
State moneys! Besides having to bear the ever-increasing
outlay in his own departmentâfor
establishment, for expenses connected with the
collection of taxes and the sale of Government
liquorâhe formed in his own Ministry subsections
of the other Ministries, such as Ways and Communications,
War, Navy, Education, Interior,
Agriculture, and Foreign Affairs. So equipped,
he planned, built, and administered the great
Eastern Chinese Railway without any reference
to the Minister of Ways and Communications;
organized and commanded two army corps, one
of Frontier Guards, and the other of guards for
the railway, and actually chose the type of gun
for their armament without reference to the
Minister of War; initiated and managed a
commercial fleet on the Pacific Ocean, and ran
a flotilla of armed river steamboats, which might
be regarded as the duty of the Naval Ministry.
As regards the work of the Department of
Education, the Finance Minister founded the
higher technical institutions; as regards the
sphere of Ministries of Interior and Agriculture,
the Finance Minister had the most important
administrationâthe so-called âalienatedâ strip
of land set aside for the Eastern Chinese Railwayâand
the building of towns and villages, and
the decision of questions concerning the taking
up of land and its cultivation; as regards the
Department of Foreign Affairs, the Finance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Minister conducted negotiations with the highest
representatives of the Chinese Administration,
concluded treaties, and maintained his commercial
and diplomatic agents in different parts
of China and Korea. There is, I believe, a
proverb to the effect that âcharity begins at
home.â<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Is it to be wondered at, therefore,
that the grants for the pet projects of the
Finance Minister were more liberal than those
for corresponding services required by the other
Ministries? The appropriations for public education
were cut down, but many millions were
spent in constructing huge buildings for polytechnic
institutes in St. Petersburg and Kieff,
magnificent blocks for the Excise Department,
and perfect palaces for officials. Immense sums
were spent on the creation of the town of Dalny,
on the Eastern Chinese Railway and its palatial
offices in Harbin, and on the services connected
with it. For this latter enterprise, which was
both a commercial and State proposition (private
as regards management, and official as regards
the supply of funds), the money was mostly
obtained from the so-called âsurpluses.â These
âsurplusesâ expanded in a manner unprecedented
in the financial records, not only of our own

case much to the detriment of the most pressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
needs of all departments. The idea underlying
the creation of a surplus was simplicity itself.
While all demands for money made by the
different departments were cut down, the estimated
receipts from revenue were also reduced.
The results were amazing. The excess of receipts
over expenditure at a time when the most
pressing requirements for national defence could
not be met for lack of funds amounted in some
years to over Â£20,000,000. The following table

<p>This showsâ</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That the difference between the estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and actual receipts amounted in 1898 and 1899 to more than Â£20,000,000

<p>(<i>b</i>) That in eight years out of twelve the actual income
exceeded the estimates by Â£10,000,000 <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That the revenue was little affected by the
war, and that for 1904 and 1905 the excess of
income over estimates was more than Â£8,000,000.
Had the calculations as to receipts, therefore,
been more accurate, it would have been quite
possible to grant to the War Ministry the
supplementary sum asked for, and thus to
enable our preparations to have been more
complete in east and west.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the main reason for our military
inefficiency was the inadequate funds granted by
the Treasury. Funds for the War Department
were stintedâ</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Owing to the greatly increased expenditure
on the fleet.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Owing to the large expenditure upon the
projects of the Minister of Finance in the Far East,
and owing to the underestimation of revenue.
But in spite of this, I think it will be allowed
that from 1898â1903, during which time it distributed
its money according to a strictly defined
plan, the War Department attained, on the
whole, remarkable results in the strengthening
of our military position in the Far East. The
results in this direction of the ten years preceding

the Russo-Japanese War can be gauged from

<p class="capsub">The War Ministerâs opinion on the Manchurian and
Korean questions from the year 1900 to 1903âWhat
he did to avoid a rupture with Japan.</p>

<p class="noindent">Not only was the war unexpected; it was against
our interests, and contrary to the wishes of the
Emperor. Had it ended victoriously, those who
were responsible for it would have found themselves
national heroes for having laid the train
for our success in the Far East with such
sagacity; but the premature peace forced on us
by our internal troubles prevented a continuation
of the struggle till victory was ours. All classes
of society were convulsed by our misfortunes,
and are now insistent in a desire to hear the
truth as to the causes of the war, and to learn
the names of those who turned a deaf ear to the
Emperorâs expressed wish for peace, and, by sins
of commission or omission, so steered the ship
of State as to bring about a rupture. The
existing freedom of the Press has already permitted
the publication of various opinions on
these subjects, and amongst much fiction certain
facts have now been revealed, the publication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
which could only have been possible with the
knowledge and permission of interested persons
holding high appointments in the different
Ministries.</p>

<p>The most important of many newspaper
articles touching upon the causes of the war is
one by M. Gurieff, entitled âThe Outbreak of
the Russo-Japanese War,â and published in the
<i>Russki Viedomost</i> in May, 1905. M. Gurieff
evidently had access to many official documents,
and the article reads as an <i>ex parte</i> statement,
in which the author holds a brief for the defence
of the Finance Minister, M. Sergius de Witte.
As this lucubration must have been widely read,
having been reprinted in foreign as well as in
Russian newspapers and magazines; as it is still
being quoted; and as the statements contained in
it concerning the Ministry of War are not correct,
and have led to a wrong construction being
placed upon the actions of that Department, I
feel constrained to state in as few words as
possible the part played by the War Minister in
Far Eastern affairs between 1898 and 1903.</p>

<p>The question of obtaining an outlet on the
Pacific Ocean was discussed in Russia some time
ago. It was thought that an exit to ice-free
seas would eventually be a necessity in view of
the immense growth of our population; but as
two centuries had shown us the cost of moving
towards the Baltic and Black Seas, it was felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
that particular care must be exercised lest, in our
desire to get access to the Pacific coast, we
should be drawn prematurely into war. Our
possessions in the Far East and Baikalia are
inaccessible wastes, where everything in the way
of development remains still to be done. Our
trade with the Far East was in every way so
insignificant, that not only did access to the
Pacific Ocean appear unnecessary for the present
generation, but it actually seemed that the
expense and sacrifices entailed in obtaining this
access would be a burden of a nature to hinder
our national development in other quarters.
During the latter half of the last century the
War Ministryâin conjunction with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairsâsystematically opposed any
extension of our frontiers in Asia in view of
what was going on in Europe. Consequently
the successive steps of our advance into the
heart of Central Asia often took place in defiance
of the opinions of and the orders issued from
St. Petersburg. The occupation of Tashkent by
Cherneff in 1864â65 was considered premature,
for it brought us into direct touch with the
Khanates of Bokhara and Khokand, and after the
expedition to Samarkand in 1868, not only was
Kaufmann not permitted to conquer the Bokhara
Khanate completely, but Shaar and Kitab,
which had been captured by us after severe
fighting, were returned to the Emir. In 1873,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
after conquering the Khiva Khanate, we confined
ourselves to taking only the right bank
of the Oxus, while we preserved the Khanâs
authority. In 1875, when traversing the whole
Khanate of Khokand, we deliberately confined
ourselves to occupying the town of
Namangan, leaving the rest of the Khanate in
the possession of its feeble ruler. In 1881 the
War Minister did not assent to our retention
of the Kuldja province, which we had captured
ten years before; and in 1882, after Skobeleff
had seized Geok Tepe, he was strictly forbidden
to advance on Merv. This consistent policy on
the part of the War Ministry was in every case
born of a fear of greater expenditure and fresh
responsibilities which could only weaken our
existing position on the western and Turkish
frontiers. Above all was the Department opposed
to starting complications with China or Japan.
It accordingly viewed with alarm, and strongly
opposed, the theory that âRussia is the most
western of Asiatic States, not the most eastern
of European,â and that her future lies entirely
in Asia. As has been explained, twenty years
ago we were practically defenceless in the
Far East. An enormous extent of country
such as Saghalien was garrisoned by only three
local detachments, totalling 1,000 men. Vladivostok
had no defences, and its main communication
with Russiaâa trunk road 6,000 miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
longâwas in a military sense absolutely useless.
It was only after 1882, when we yielded
to China over Kuldja, and when Japan began
increasing her army, that we began to augment
the number of our troops in that quarter.</p>

<p>The Department was all the time keenly alive
to the precarious nature of our communications
between the Pri-Amur and Russia, and recruits
and a large proportion of supplies were sent to
Vladivostok by sea. Under such conditions it
was, of course, quite out of the question to
dream of any offensive operations or even schemes
of offence; but the awakening of China and
Japan caused much uneasiness for our safety east
of Lake Baikal, and the project for the construction
of the Siberian Railway through our own
territory was welcomed as facilitating communication.
The question of the construction of this
railway-line was first discussed by a committee
of Ministers in 1875, but the scheme was then
confined to a line within the limits of European
Russia as far as Tumen. In 1880 a resolution
was passed sanctioning this portion. In 1882
the Emperor Alexander II., dissatisfied with this
partial scheme, decided that the line should be
laid right through Siberia. Surveys were accordingly
made, and three alternative routes were
put forward. In 1885, after examining these
alternatives, the committee were unable to come
to any conclusion as to the most advantageous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
but they decided to set to work at once to
construct the first portion of the railway. In
1886, upon receipt of a report by the Governor-General
of Eastern Siberia, the Emperor wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âSo far as I have read the report of the
Governor-General, I am grieved to observe that
the Government has up till now done practically
nothing to meet the requirements of this rich
but neglected country. And it is timeâindeed
timeâthat something should be done.â</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding such a strongly worded animadversion
on the part of the Emperor, it was
only in February, 1891, that the committee put
on record its decision to build simultaneously
the Ussuri Railway and the portion of the
Siberian line from Mias to Cheliabinsk. In a
rescript to the Tsarevitch, who was then on his
voyage round the world, it was explained that
the line would run âright across the whole of
Siberia,â and be called the Great Siberian Railway.
The idea underlying this scheme was as
simple as it was bold, and the line would undoubtedly
have put life into a very slowly
developing country, would have attracted a large
number of colonists, and would thus have secured
to us an important region. Of course, as it ran
along the Chinese frontier for the greater part
of its length, it would not have been free from
danger; but the risk was diminished by the comparative
inaccessibility of the part of Northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Manchuria adjacent to the railway and the weakness
of China. Moreover, it was covered by the
mighty Amur River.</p>

<p>After the Chino-Japanese War we, in conjunction
with other Powers, compelled Japan
to abandon Port Arthur and the Kuan-tung
Peninsula, which she had just conquered. This,
the first of the acts of Russia to excite Japanâs
hostility, was also by far the most decisive. A
new state of affairs now arose in the Far East
which made our complete military unreadiness
seem alarming, especially as the Pri-Amur was
at that time practically defenceless against an
offensive movement by the Japanese. Throughout
the immense expanse of this military district
there were only nineteen infantry battalions, and
we were at once obliged to start increasing our
troops in the Far East and turning Vladivostok
into a naval fortress; but the most urgent question
was that of establishing railway communication.</p>

<p>Before the Chino-Japanese War no one
imagined that the Siberian line would be laid
anywhere but through our own territory. The
weakness displayed by China at that time, however,
formed an inducement to carry it through
Manchuria, and thus shorten the distance by
over 300 miles. In vain did General Dukhovski,
Governor-General and Commander of the troops
in the Pri-Amur district, protest and point out
the risks of such a course. He argued that, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the rail passed through Chinese territory, not
only would it be of advantage to the Chinese
instead of to the Russian settler population, but
it would be insecure. His views did not find
acceptance, and this great artery of communicationâof
incalculable importance to usâwas
laid through a foreign country. The temptation
to give as far as possible an international importance
to this line by attracting all trans-continental
through-traffic proved too strong for the
modest claim for consideration of the Pri-Amur
district, though it was one that concerned us
very deeply. General Dukhovskiâs fears were
soon justified. Part of the line was destroyed
by a rising of the people in 1900, and our troops
in Harbin were forced upon the defensive. We
lost a whole year, wasted millions of money, and
only too soon began to realize that, except a very
limited quantity of the most perishable freight,
no goods would be sent by rail. Sea transport
was cheaper and safer. We were forced to
abandon our dreams of international importance
for the line, and to confess that it merely constituted
a portion of the Siberian Railway, which,
as it ran for 800 miles through a foreign country,
would require special protection at great cost.
Moreover, the Finance Ministerâs estimate of the
savingâÂ£1,500,000âto be effected by taking
the line through Manchuria, instead of through
Siberia, proved entirely misleading, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
mileage cost of the line worked out to a much
larger figure than that of any railway undertaking
in Russia! Not only was all idea of
the lineâs international importance very quickly
abandoned, but it soon became only too clear
that its economic value, though important to the
local Chinese population, would be very slight
for Russia. Its <i>raison dâÃªtre</i> must then have
been mainly strategic. But, if built on strategic
grounds, surely a route through our own territory
would have been preferable? This unfortunate
enterprise, which turned out so badly for Russia,
was the first outward sign of an active policy
which was to have such great results. The
occupation of Port Arthur, the creation of
Dalny, the construction of the southern branch
of the line, the maintenance of a commercial
fleet in the Far East, and our business enterprises
in Korea, were all links in the chain which was to
bind these distant tracts so securely to Russia.</p>

<p>It is thought in some quarters that if we had
confined ourselves to the construction of the
northern line through Manchuria, there would
have been no war; that it was the occupation
of Port Arthur and Mukden and, in particular,
our activity in Korea which caused it. In the
opinion of others, the railway through Manchuria
cannot be looked upon as merely the commencement
of our activity, but must be regarded as
the foundation of it all; for if we had run the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
line along the banks of the Amur in our own
territory, it would never have occurred to us to
occupy Southern Manchuria and Kuan-tung.
It is quite true that the northern portion of the
line passing through Manchuria could never
have disturbed our friendly relations with China,
and I am personally convinced that if we had
been satisfied with this, Japan would never
have started a war with us for the sake of
Northern Manchuria. In any case, the line
through Manchuria was built neither in the
interests nor at the instance of the War Department,
and was carried through in spite of the
opposition of General Dukhovski, its representative
on the spot. The Boxer rebellion in Manchuria
showed up our military weakness, and the
hope of the Finance Minister that the local
guards raised by him would be able to protect
the line without the assistance of troops supplied
by the War Department was not realized. Even
when the rising became general, he begged us not
to despatch to Manchuria the troops which
General Grodekovi and Admiral Alexeieff were
holding in readiness in Pri-Amur and the Kuan-tung
district. His advice was taken, but this
delay in sending reinforcements to the railway
cost us dear. Almost the whole of the line
north of the Eastern Chinese main line, with the
exception of the section near Harbin, as well as
a great length of the southern branch, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
with the stations of Kuang-cheng-tzu, Mukden,
and Liao-yang, were seized by the rebels. The
local railway guards, commanded by Generals
Gerngros and Mischenko, behaved with gallantry,
but, overcome by superior numbers, they were
forced to retire from almost all the points they
had occupied, and the greater part of them were
concentrated at Harbin, where they were besieged
by the insurgents. Finally, it was by
direct order of the Emperor that the War
Ministry took action in concentrating troops to
put down the rising. Railway communication
with Trans-Baikalia was then in existence, and
the sea was also open to us, and by the autumn
of 1900 we had collected by land and water
an army of 100,000 men, and rapidly quelled
the rebellion. The capture of Peking,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the headquarters
of the Boxer movement, by the Allied
troops under General Linievitch was also instrumental
in restoring order in Manchuria, while the
energy with which General Grodekovi organized
and despatched columns into Manchuria itself,
and so relieved General Gerngros in Harbin, is
worthy of notice. Tsitsihar and Kirin were
captured by General Rennenkampf; Mukden,
by General Subotin.</p>

<p>Once order was restored, the War Department
set to work to withdraw our troops from
the province of Pei-chih-li as quickly as possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and succeeded in doing so in spite of the disapproval
of Count Waldersee;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> all the reinforcements
from Siberia and European Russia
returned. The damage done to the railway was
considerable, and all idea of its completion during
1900 was abandoned, and a whole yearâthe
importance of which has been little realizedâwas
lost. Had we been in sufficient strength to
maintain order on the line in 1900, the railway
would have been in a far greater state of readiness
in 1904; the transport of reinforcements in
1903, and the concentration in 1904, would have
been accomplished far more rapidly than it was,
and we should in all probability have had two or
three more army corps at Liao-yang than we
actually had. The rising in 1900 clearly showed
that it was impossible, with our main line of
railway running for 800 miles through Chinese
territory, to count on maintaining secure communication
with Russia in the future. To
insure our position it was necessary to build
a line rapidly within our own territory along the
left bank of the Amur, and at the same time to
place Northern Manchuria in such a condition
that it would not, with the aid of the line we
had already built, continue to be a source of
weakness to us in the Far East.</p>

<p>As the Manchurian and Korean questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
were the causes of the war, it is necessary to
touch on the War Ministerâs views with regard
to them in some detail. The duties which
Russia of her own accord took upon herself in
Manchuria are based on the Government <i>communiquÃ©</i>
of September 1, 1900, in which a
circular telegram from the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, dated August 25, 1900, was quoted.
In this telegram it was stated that our Government
was mainly guided by the following axiom,
amongst others, with regard to Chinese affairs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe <i>status quo ante</i> in China must be preserved,
and everything that may tend to a partition
of the Celestial Empire is to be avoided.â</p></div>

<p>It continued that if, owing to any action of
the Chinese, we should be forced to send troops
into Manchuria and to occupy Newchuang, such
temporary measures were on no account to be
taken as evidence of any self-interested schemes
outside the general policy of the Imperial
Government, and that, as soon as order was
permanently restored in Manchuria and the
railway protectedâ</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>ââRussia would not fail to withdraw her
forces, provided that no difficulty were placed
in the way of such withdrawal by the action
of the other Powers.â</p></div>

<p>This announcement appeared at a time when
we had over 100,000 men in arms in Asia. There
can, therefore, be no question of our sincere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
intentionâat that timeâto evacuate Manchuria.
In 1901 these promises were repeated by our
Government in a similar <i>communiquÃ©</i> of April 5.
Neither the opposition of China nor the Anglo-Japanese
Treaty concluded in 1902, which was
unmistakably directed against us, were at the
moment considered sufficient to warrant our
abandoning all hope of fulfilling our promise to
withdrew from Manchuria.</p>

<p>But so long ago as 1900 it had seemed doubtful
whether we should be able to carry out this
promise. In the first place, it was impossible to
ignore entirely the advice of the authorities on
the spot, who did not consider a withdrawal was
either desirable or possible in our own interests.
The action of the Chinese officials in Manchuria,
the existence of bands of Hun-huses, and the
serious military expeditions we had been forced
to make in 1901âall strengthened the opinion of
our commanders out there that we had been in
too great haste to promise the evacuation of the
country. Notwithstanding these doubts, a treaty
was concluded with China in April, 1902. This
was but the logical development of the official
pronouncements made in 1900 and 1901. At
first it was supposed that this agreement would
lead to a definite settlement of our position in the
Far East, but it soon became apparent that there
was little ground for such hope. The immense
expenditure from 1900 to 1903 on the railway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the army, and the fleet, gave birth to and
nourished the fixed idea that our most vital interests
would not be sufficiently guarded if we
strictly observed the treaty made in April. China
viewed us with suspicion, and was almost openly
hostile; Japan was openly hostile; while all the
other Powers distrusted us. Our foothold in
Manchuria also seemed precarious, and in spite
of hurrying on the construction and increasing
its guards, the railway was by no means secure.
Trains had to be escorted on account of the frequent
raids by Hun-huses, and no trust could be
placed in either the natives or their officials. All
this showed that if we confined ourselves merely
to protecting the line itself, it would be destroyed
in many places at the first rising. Our position
would then be serious in the extreme if we should
be attacked on the western frontier while carrying
on a war in the east. There is no doubt whatever
that, if trouble had arisen in the west, and
our troops had been withdrawn from Manchuria,
a repetition of the Chinese disorders of 1900
might easily have occurred; our communications
with the Pri-Amur would again have been interrupted,
and we should have had to reconquer
Manchuria.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> With each month that passed the
doubt as to our ability to carry out the terms of
the treaty of April increased, and this difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
period of uncertainty turned to one of acute
anxiety on account of the increasing hostility to
us of China and Japan. Officially, we continued to
give assurances that we should keep to our engagement,
and we even carried out the first portion
of it by withdrawing our troops from that part
of the Mukden province up to the River Liao;
but we were, as a matter of fact, already taking
steps essential to our own interests, but absolutely
at variance with the treaty.</p>

<p>Before the Boxer rising of 1900 I had expressed
the opinion that Northern and Southern
Manchuria possessed entirely different values for
us, the greater importance of the former being
due to the various considerations. In the first
place, the country through which the main Siberian
line passed was of special importance, because
upon it depended the security of our communication,
and because the experience of 1900 had
shown the extreme weakness of its protection as
organized by the Finance Minister. I therefore
asked that a small force of four infantry battalions,
one battery, and one squadron of Cossacks might
be stationed on the line as a mobile reserve at
Harbin, in addition to the local railway guards.
Barracks for a force of this size were built,
and were ready for occupation in 1903; but
placing troops merely along the line itselfâand
a small number at thatâwould have been of no use
if China had intended to make things unpleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
for us in Manchuria. The line would have been
cut, and the culprits would never have been discovered,
for the officials, who outwardly <i>kow-towed</i>
to us, were all the time acting in accordance with instructions
from Peking. The only thing we could
expect was an influx of Chinese into Northern
Manchuria, and the crowding of the tracts
bordering on the Chinese frontier. Against this,
even complete annexation of Northern Manchuria
did not appear to me desirable, or likely to serve
any useful purpose, as the Chinese population so
annexed, possessing the rights of citizenship and
settling along the left bank of the Amur, would
have swamped the native population of the Amur
and coast districts.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> During the whole of the
last century we had only succeeded in colonizing
very sparsely with our own people that part of
Siberia east of Trans-Baikalia to the sea, which
means that the bonds binding it to Russia were
extremely weak. In the Amur and coast districts,
with a frontier of 1,600 miles bordering on
China (from Trans-Baikalia to the sea), the whole
population only consisted of 400,000. Northern
Manchuria, of about 450,000 square miles in
extent, includes the whole of the Kheilutsianski
and the northern part of the Kirin provinces.
According to available information, it had before
the war only 1,500,000 inhabitants. This works
out at three persons per square mile. The Boxer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
rising of 1900 indicated that, so long as the affairs
of the people in Northern Manchuria continued
to be controlled from Peking, we must expect
risings and attempts to destroy the line, for the
Chinese Government always had a ready reply to
our protests: âIt is the Hun-huses who are the
culprits.â Nor could we regard without apprehension
the increases to the Chinese forces in
Northern Manchuria, and the settling of Chinese
on the waste lands adjacent to the Rivers Amur
and Argun, where our people had for a long time
been settled. It was necessary, therefore, that
we should have, in some form or other, the
right of control and of generally making our own
arrangements in Northern Manchuria. Without
this our weakly guarded railway might be a
positive disadvantage, as it added to the vulnerability
of our frontier line, which makes a large
bend to the north between Trans-Baikalia and
the Ussuri region, the whole of the Kheilutsianski
and the northern part of the Kirin province
running wedgewise into our territory. Only by
the security of Northern Manchuria could we
feel sufficiently at ease about the Pri-Amur
region to start its development.</p>

<p>Now, Northern Manchuria is not next to Korea,
and our permanent occupation of it would consequently
not have threatened complications with
Japan, nor were there in it important European
interests which might have been disturbed. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
was, however, undoubtedly important to China,
with whom its forcible annexation by us might
lead to complications. It therefore devolved
upon us to find some method of consolidating
our position in this region which would not cause
a rupture with China. Thus I was strongly in
favour of including Northern Manchuria in some
way or the other within our sphere of influence;
but I was at the same time absolutely opposed
to any quasi-political or military enterprise in
Southern Manchuria.</p>

<p>This region, up to the Kuan-tung district,
includes the whole of the Mukden and the
southern part of the Kirin province. Though
only one-quarter the size of Northern Manchuria,
the population was more than 8,000,000. This
works out at more than seventy souls per square
mile, as compared with about three for the
latter. Mukden, sacred to the Chinese dynasty,
might always be a source of misunderstanding with
China, and our contact with Korea for 533 miles
might easily lead to complications with Japan.</p>

<p>Southern Manchuria, contracting in a wedge-shape,
borders on Kuan-tung, and has only
530 odd miles on the Korean frontier. The
occupation of it, therefore, would necessitate
having two fronts, one towards Korea and one
towards China. If an enemy were superior at
sea, he could threaten a landing along the
400-mile-long coast of Southern Manchuria. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
landing in Newchuang,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> for example, would have
taken all our troops south of that place in the rear.
In discussing possible solutions of this problem,
it might be suggestedâin the event of any unfriendly
action on the part of Chinaâthat we
should obtain possession of Manchuria in the
same way as we had secured the Kuan-tung
Peninsula. If we did, this would secure our
communication with the latter. Being convinced,
as I have said, that the inclusion of
Northern Manchuria within our sphere followed
as the natural consequence of running the Siberian
main line through Manchuria, I felt equally
sure that any kind of annexation of Southern
Manchuria would be dangerous.</p>

<p>In a special memorandum upon the Manchurian
question which I submitted to the Tsar in
October, 1903, I expressed myself as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âIf we do not touch the boundary of Korea,
and do not garrison the country between it and
the railway, we shall really prove to the Japanese
that we have no intention of seizing Korea as
well as Manchuria. They will then in all probability
confine themselves to the peaceful furtherance
of their interests in the Peninsula, and
will neither enter into a military occupation of it
nor greatly increase the strength of their home
army. This will relieve us of the necessity of
augmenting our numbers in the Far East, and of
supporting the heavy burden otherwise necessary
even should there be no war. If, on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
hand, we annex Southern Manchuria, all the
questions that now trouble us and threaten to
set the two nations by the ears will become
more critical. Our temporary occupation of
certain points between the railway and Korea
will become permanent, our attention will be
more and more attracted to the Korean frontier,
and our attitude will confirm the Japanese in their
suspicions that we intend to seize that peninsula.</p>

<p>âThat our occupation of Southern Manchuria
will lead to a Japanese occupation of Southern
Korea there cannot be the slightest doubt; but
beyond that all is uncertain. One thing, however,
is certain. If Japan takes this step, she
will be compelled rapidly to increase her military
strength, and we, in turn, shall have to reply
by enlarging our Far Eastern force. Thus two
nations whose interests are so different that they
would seem destined to live peaceably, will begin
a contest in time of peace, in which each will try
to surpass the other in preparations for war.
We Russians can only do this at the expense of
our strength in the west, and of the vital interests
of the people at largeâall for the sake of
portions of a country which really has no serious
importance for us. Moreover, if other Powers
take part in this rivalry, the struggle for military
supremacy is liable at any moment to change
into a deadly conflict, which may not only retard
the peaceful development of our Far Eastern
possessions for a long time, but may result in a
set-back to the whole Empire.</p>

<p>âEven if we should defeat Japan on the mainlandâin
Korea and Manchuriaâwe could not
destroy her, nor obtain decisive results, without
carrying the war into her territory. That, of
course, would not be absolutely impossible, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to invade a country with a warlike population of
47,000,000, where even the women participate in
wars of national defence, would be a serious
undertaking even for a Power as strong as Russia.
And if we do not utterly destroy Japanâif we
do not deprive her of the right and the power to
maintain a navyâshe will wait for the first convenient
opportunityâtill, for instance, we are
engaged in war in the westâto attack us, either
single-handed or in co-operation with our European
enemies.</p>

<p>âIt must not be forgotten that Japan can not
only quickly throw a well-organized and well-trained
army of from 150,000 to 180,000 men
into Korea or Manchuria, but can do this without
drawing at all heavily upon her population. If
we accept the German ratio of regular troops to
populationânamely, 1 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>âwe shall see
that she can, with her 47,000,000 of people, maintain,
instead of 120,000, a force of 400,000 men
in time of peace, and 1,000,000 in time of war.
Even if we reduce this estimate by one-quarter,
Japan will be able to oppose us on the mainland
with a regular army of from 300,000 to 350,000
men. If we mean to annex Manchuria, we shall
be compelled to bring up our numbers to a point
which will enable our troops in the Far East
alone to withstand a Japanese attack.â</p></div>

<p>From the above lines it will be seen how
seriously the War Department regarded such an
antagonist as Japan, and how much anxiety it
felt concerning possible complications with that
Power on account of Korea. Still, so long as
we adhered to our decision to evacuate Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Manchuria, and not to interfere in Korean affairs,
the danger of a rupture was removed. In 1900
our Government had been obliged to respect the
territorial integrity of China, and the question of
evacuating Manchuria had been in principle decided
in the affirmative; and if we were preparing
to leave the country, we certainly could not at
the same time be preparing it as a theatre of
military operations.</p>

<p>As regards the evacuation, there was a difference
of opinion between Admiral Alexeieff (the
Commander of the Kuan-tung district) and
myself as to the importance to us of Southern
Manchuria. I believed that the occupation of
Manchuria would bring us no profit, and would
involve us in trouble with Japan on the one
side, through our nearness to Korea, and with
China on the other side, through our possession
of Mukden. I therefore regarded the speedy
evacuation of Southern Manchuria and Mukden
as a matter of absolute necessity. The Commander
of the Kuan-tung district, on the other
hand, whose duty it was to defend that district,
thought fit to contend that a permanent occupation
of Southern Manchuria would be the best
guarantee of our communications with Russia.
There was also a minor difference of opinion
between the Finance Minister and myself with
regard to the withdrawal of our troops from
Northern Manchuria. He thought that it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
suffice to leave the Frontier Guards only for
the protection of the railway. Guided by our
experience in quelling the Boxer rising in 1900,
I considered it necessary, after withdrawing our
troops as quickly as possible from Southern
Manchuria, to remove them from all populated
places in Northern Manchuria which were off the
line of rail, including Kirin and Tsitsihar, and to
station a small reserve at Harbin on the line
itself in case of disorder. This reserve need not
have been stronger than two to four infantry
battalions and one battery of artillery. Moreover,
I thought we ought to continue to guard
communication between Harbin and Khabarovsk
along the Sungari, and between Tsitsihar and
Blagovieschensk, by the maintenance of a few
small military posts. These differences of opinion,
however, ceased to exist with the ratification of
the Russo-Chinese Treaty of April 1, 1902. By
the terms of that convention our troopsâwith
the exception of those guarding the railwayâwere
to be removed from all parts of Manchuria,
Southern as well as Northern, within specified
periods. This settlement of the question was a
great relief to the War Department, because it
held out the hope of a âreturn to the westâ in
our military affairs. In the first period of six
months we were to evacuate the western part of
Southern Manchuria, from Shan-hai-kuan to the
River Liao; this we punctually did. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
second period of six months we were to remove
our troops from the rest of the province of
Mukden, including the cities of Mukden and
Newchuang. The Department regarded the
arrangement to evacuate the province of Mukden
with approval, and made energetic preparations
to carry it into effect. Barracks were hastily
erected between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
for the soldiers to be withdrawn into the Pri-Amur
country; the scheme of transportation
was drawn up and approved; the movement of
troops had begun, and Mukden had actually
been evacuated, when suddenly everything was
stopped by order of Admiral Alexeieff, the
Commander of the Kuan-tung district. His
reasons for taking such action have not, to this
day, been sufficiently cleared up. It is definitely
known, however, that the change in policy which
stopped the withdrawal of troops from Southern
Manchuria corresponded in time with the first
visit to the Far East of State Councillor Bezobrazoff
(retired). Mukden, which we had already
evacuated, was reoccupied, as was also the city
of Newchuang. The Ya-lu timber concession<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
assumed more importance than ever, and in
order to give support to it and our other undertakings
in Northern Korea, Admiral Alexeieff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sent a mounted force with guns to Feng-huang-cheng.
Thus, far from completing the evacuation
of Southern Manchuria, we actually moved
into parts of it that we had never before
occupied. At the same time, we allowed operations
in connection with the Korean timber
concession to go on, despite the fact that the
promoters of this enterprise were striving to give
to it a political and military character contrary
to instructions from St. Petersburg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="alexeieff">
<img alt="" width="500px" height="auto"
       src="images/alexeieff.jpg" />
<div class="caption">VICE-ADMIRAL ALEXEIEFF.</div>
</div>

<p>This unexpected change of policy alarmed
both China and Japan, and there is good reason
to believe that the stoppage of the evacuation of
the province of Mukden was an event of supreme
importance. So long as we held to our intention
of withdrawing all our troops from Manchuria,
confined ourselves to the protection of the line
by the Frontier Guards and a small reserve at
Harbin, and refrained from intruding in Korea,
there was little danger of a break with Japan;
but we were brought alarmingly near a rupture
with that Power when, contrary to our agreement
with China, we left our troops in Southern
Manchuria, and entered Northern Korea in
pursuit of our timber enterprise. The uncertainty
as to our intentions, moreover, alarmed
not only China and Japan, but even England,
America, and other Powers.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1903 our position became
extremely involved. The interests of the Pri-Amur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
were by this time pushed completely into
the background; even General Dukhovski, its
Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief, was
not consulted upon the most important points
concerning the Far East. Meanwhile, immense
enterprises involving many millions of pounds
were being created and controlled on independent
lines in Manchuria, on Chinese territory.
The Minister of Finance (M. de Witte) was building
and managing over 1,300 miles of railway.
The alignment of the northern portion was, as I
have explained, fixed in direct opposition to the
opinion of General Dukhovski, our chief authority
in those parts, while under the orders of the
Finance Minister an army corps was organized
for the protection of the line. So independent,
indeed, was the latter in his conduct of purely
military matters that a pattern of gun for the
railway guard was settled, and the gun purchased
abroad without reference to the War Ministry.
To assist in the economic development of the
railway, M. de Witte started a fleet of sea-going
merchant ships; for work on the Manchurian
rivers he ran a flotilla of river steamers, some of
which were armed. Vladivostok was no longer
considered suitable as a terminus for a trans-continental
trunk line, so, regardless of the fact
that the Kuan-tung district was under the War
Department and immediately under the officer
commanding the troops in it (Admiral Alexeieff),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Dalny was selected and created as a great port
without reference to either. Huge sums were
spent on this place, which adversely affected the
military importance and strength of Port Arthur,
as it was necessary either to fortify Dalny or be
prepared for its seizure and employment by an
enemy as a base of operations against usâa
thing which afterwards happened. I should add
that the Russo-Chinese Bank was also in the
Finance Ministerâs hands. Finally, M. de Witte
maintained his own representatives in Peking,
Seoul, etc. (Pokotiloff in Peking). It so happened,
therefore, that in this year our Minister
of Finance was managing in the Far East railways,
a flotilla of merchant steamers, a certain
number of armed vessels, the port of Dalny, and
the Russo-Chinese Bank. He also had under
his command an army corps. At the same time
Bezobrazoff and his company were developing
their concessions in Manchuria and Korea, and
promoting by every possible means their timber
speculation on the Ya-lu in Northern Korea.
One incredible scheme of Bezobrazoffâs followed
another. His idea was to utilize the Timber
Company as a sort of âscreenâ or barrier against
a possible attack upon us by the Japanese, and
during 1902 and 1903 his activity and that of
his adherents assumed a very alarming character.
Among requests that he made of Admiral
Alexeieff were to send into Korean territory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
600 soldiers in civilian dress, to organize for
service in the same locality a force of 3,000
Hun-huses, to support the agents of the Timber
Company by sending 600 mounted rifles to
Sha-ho-tzu on the Ya-lu, and to occupy Feng-huang-cheng
with a detached force. Admiral
Alexeieff refused some of these requests, but
unfortunately consented to send 150 mounted
rifles to Sha-ho-tzu, and to move a Cossack
regiment with guns to the latter place. This
action was particularly harmful to us, as it
was taken just at the time when we were
under obligations to evacuate the province of
Mukden altogether. As has already been stated,
instead of withdrawing, we advanced towards
Korea.</p>

<p>The Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs,
and War (de Witte, Lamsdorff, and myself), all
recognized the danger that would threaten us if
we continued to defer fulfilment of the promised
evacuation, and, more especially, if we failed to
put an end to Bezobrazoffâs activity in Korea.
We three Ministers, therefore, procured the appointment
of a special council, which assembled
in St. Petersburg on April 18, 1903, to consider
certain propositions which Bezobrazoff had made
to its members in a special memorandum. These
proposals had for their object the strengthening
of Russiaâs strategic position in the basin
of the Ya-lu. We three Ministers on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
committee expressed ourselves firmly and definitely
in opposition to Bezobrazoffâs proposals, and all
agreed that if his enterprise on the Ya-lu was to
be sustained, it must be upon a strictly commercial
basis. The Minister of Finance showed
conclusively that, for the next five or ten years,
Russiaâs task in the Far East must be to tranquillize
the country, and bring to completion
the work already undertaken there. He said,
furthermore, that although the views of the
different departments of the Government were
not always precisely the same, there had never
beenâso far as the Ministers of War, Foreign
Affairs, and Finance were concernedâany conflict
of action. The Minister of Foreign Affairs
pointed out particularly the danger involved in
Bezobrazoffâs proposal to stop the withdrawal of
troops from Manchuria.</p>

<p>It pleased His Imperial Majesty to say, after
he had listened to these expressions of opinion,
that war with Japan was extremely undesirable,
and that we must endeavour to restore in
Manchuria a state of tranquillity. The company
formed for the purpose of exploiting the timber
on the River Ya-lu must be a strictly commercial
organization, must admit foreigners who desired
to participate, and must exclude all ranks of the
army. I was then ordered to proceed to the
Far East, for the purpose of acquainting myself,
on the spot, with our needs, and ascertaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
what the state of mind was in Japan. In the
latter country, where I met with the most
cordial and kind-hearted reception, I became
convinced that the Government desired to avoid
a rupture with Russia, but that it would be
necessary for us to act in a perfectly definite way
in Manchuria, and to refrain from interference
in the affairs of Korea. If we permitted the
schemes of Bezobrazoff and Company to continue,
we should be in danger of a conflict. These
conclusions I telegraphed to St. Petersburg.
After my departure from that city, however, the
danger of a rupture with Japan, on account of
Korea, had increased considerably, especially
when, on May 20, 1903, the Minister of Finance
announced that, âafter having had an explanation
from State Councillor Bezobrazoff, he (the
Minister) was not in disagreement with him so
far as the essence of the matter was concerned.â</p>

<p>In the council held at Port Arthur, when I
arrived, Admiral Alexeieff, Lessar,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Pavloff,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and I cordially agreed that the Ya-lu enterprise
should have a purely commercial character; and
I added, moreover, that, in my opinion, it ought
to be abandoned altogether. I brought about
the recall of several army officers who were
taking part in it, and suggested to Lieutenant-Colonel
Madritoff, who was managing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
military and political side of it, that he should
either resign his commission or give up employment
which, in my judgment, was not suitable
for an officer wearing the uniform of the General
Staff. He chose the former alternative.</p>

<p>All the military requests made by Admiral
Alexeieff, after consulting with the senior officers
in the Kuan-tung district, were carried out with
great promptitude. My recommendations and
orders were made in Port Arthur, and issued
by despatch. In the autumn of 1903 I was
thanked by him for acting on his recommendations
so promptly. In view of the repeated
assurances given me by Admiral Alexeieff that
he was wholly opposed to Bezobrazoffâs schemes,
that he was holding them back with all his
strength, and that he was a firm advocate of a
peaceful Russo-Japanese agreement, I left Port
Arthur for St. Petersburg in July, 1903, fully
believing that the avoidance of a rupture with
Japan was a matter entirely within our control.
The results of my visit to the Far East were
embodied in a special report to the Emperor,
submitted August 6, 1903, in which I expressed
with absolute frankness the opinion that if we
did not put an end to the uncertain state of
affairs in Manchuria, and to the adventurous
activity of Bezobrazoff in Korea, we must expect
a rupture with Japan. Copies of this report
were sent to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the Minister of Finance, and met with their
approval. By some means unknown to me, this
report was given publicity, and on June 24, 1905,
the newspaper <i>Razsvet</i> printed an article, by a
certain M. Roslavleff, entitled âWhich is the
Greater?â the object of which was to prove that I
ought to be included amongst those responsible for
the rupture with Japan, because, through fear of
Bezobrazoff, I signed a paper drawn up in Port
Arthur, which put the Ya-lu enterprise under
the protection of Russian troops, and thus
stopped the evacuation of Manchuria. This
article has been reprinted by many Russian and
foreign journals, and there has never been any
refutation of the misstatements that it contains
with regard to my alleged action in signing this
imaginary memorandum.</p>

<p>In view of the special publicity this effusion
received, and of the gravity of the accusations
levelled against me, I will give a few extracts from
it. M. Roslavleff quotes from my report to the
Emperor the following sentences and paragraphs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âOur actions in the basin of the Ya-lu, and
our behaviour in Manchuria, have excited in
Japan a feeling of hostility which, upon our
taking any incautious step, may lead to war&hellip;.
State Secretary Bezobrazoffâs plan of operations,
if carried out, will inevitably lead to a violation
of the agreement that we made with China on
April 8, 1902, and will also, as inevitably, cause
complications with Japan&hellip;. The actions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
State Secretary Bezobrazoff toward the end of
last, and at the beginning of this, year have
already practically caused a violation of the
treaty with China and a breach with Japan&hellip;.
At the request of Bezobrazoff, Admiral Alexeieff
sent a force of mounted rifles to Sha-ho-tzu (on
the Ya-lu), and kept a body of troops in Feng-huang-cheng.
These measures put a stop to the
evacuation of the province of Mukden&hellip;.
Among other participants in the Ya-lu enterprise
who have given trouble to Admiral Alexeieff is
Acting State Councillor Balasheff, who has a
disposition quite as warlike as that of Bezobrazoff.
If Admiral Alexeieff had not succeeded in stopping
a despatch from Balasheff to Captain
Bodisco with regard to âcatching all the Japanese,â
âpunishing them publicly,â and âtaking action
with volleys,â there would have been a bloody
episode on the Ya-lu before this. Unfortunately,
it is liable to happen even now any day&hellip;.
During my stay in Japan, I had opportunities of
seeing with what nervous apprehension the people
regarded our activity on the Ya-lu, how they
exaggerated our intentions, and how they
were preparing to defend by force their Korean
interests. Our active operations there have convinced
them that Russia is now about to proceed
to the second part of her Far Eastern programmeâthat,
having swallowed Manchuria, she is
preparing to gulp down Korea. The excitement
in Japan is such that if Admiral Alexeieff had
not shown wise cautionâif he had allowed all
the proposals of Bezobrazoff to be put in trainâwe
should probably be at war with Japan now.
There is no reason whatever to suppose that a
few officers and reservists, cutting timber on the
Ya-lu, will be of any use in a war with Japan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Their value is trifling in comparison with the
danger that the timber enterprise creates by
keeping up the excitement among the Japanese
people&hellip;. Suffice it to say that, in the opinion
of Admiral Alexeieff, and of our Ministers in
Peking, Seoul, and Tokio, the timber concession
may be the cause of hostilities, and in this opinion
I fully concur.â</p></div>

<p>After quoting the above extracts from my
report, M. Roslavleff says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThus warmly, eloquently, and shrewdly did
Kuropatkin condemn the Ya-lu adventure, and
thus clearly did he see on the political horizon
the ruinous consequences that it would have for
Russia. But why did this bold and clear-sighted
censor not protest against the decision of the
Port Arthur council? Why, after making a few
caustic remarks about Bezobrazoff, did he sign
the paper which put the Ya-lu adventure under
the protection of Russian troops, and thus stop
the evacuation of Manchuria? Why did not
the other members, who shared Kuropatkinâs
opinion as to the great danger of Bezobrazoffâs
adventurous schemes, and expected a rupture
with Japan to be imminent, prevent, on the
authority of those July councils at Port Arthur,
Bezobrazoffâs political and economic escapades?
Why did they, on the contrary, with Kuropatkin,
put their signatures to a document which admitted
Bezobrazoffâs enterprises as useful Government
undertakings, ratify a treacherous policy in China,
Korea, and Japan, and so lay the first stone in
the monument of indelible shame erected by
the war? Why? Simply because at that time
everybody was afraid of Bezobrazoff.â</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Such accusations, which have had wide publicity,
require an explanation.</p>

<p>The council held at Port Arthur, in June,
1903, was called for the purpose of finding, if
possible, some means of settling the Manchurian
question without lowering the dignity of Russia.
There were present at this council, in addition
to Admiral Alexeieff and myself, Acting State
Councillor Lessar, Russian Minister in China;
Chamberlain Pavloff, Russian Minister in Seoul;
Major-General Vogak; State Councillor Bezobrazoff;
and M. Plancon, an officer of the diplomatic
service. We were all acquainted with the
wish of the Emperor, that our enterprises in the Far
East should not lead to war, and we had to devise
means of carrying the Imperial will into effect.
With regard to these means there were differences
of opinion, but upon fundamental questions there
was complete agreement. Among these wereâ</p>

<p>1. <i>The Manchurian Question.</i>âOn July&nbsp;3 the
council expressed its judgment with regard to
this question as follows: âIn view of the extraordinary
difficulties and enormous administrative
expenses that the annexation of Manchuria
would involve, all the members of the council
agree that it is, in principle, undesirable; and
this conclusion applies not only to Manchuria as
a whole, but also to its northern part.â</p>

<p>2. <i>The Korean Question.</i>âOn July&nbsp;2 the
council decided that the occupation of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of Korea, or even of the northern part, would
be unprofitable to Russia, and therefore undesirable.
Our activity in the basin of the
Ya-lu, moreover, might give Japan reason to
fear a seizure by us of the northern part of the
Peninsula. On July&nbsp;7 the council called upon
Acting State Councillor Balasheff, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Madritoff of the General Staff, to
appear before it, and explain the status of the
Ya-lu enterprise. From their testimony it appeared
that the concern was legally organized,
the company holding permits from the Chinese
authorities to cut timber on the northern side,
and a concession from the Korean Government
covering the southern side of the Ya-lu.
Although the enterprise had lost, to a great
extent, its provocative character after the conclusions
of the St. Petersburg council of
April 18, 1903, became known in the province
of Kuan-tung, its operations could not yet be
regarded as purely commercial. On July&nbsp;7 the
company had in its employ 9 senior agents, of
whom one was an officer of the army; 97 or
98 reservists, who went down the river in
charge of rafts from Sha-ho-tzu to its mouth;
some 200 Chinamen (from Chifu), and about
900 Koreans. Its affairs were managed by
Lieutenant-Colonel Madritoff, although that
officer was not officially in the companyâs
service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>After consideration of all the facts put forward,
the members of the council came to the
unanimous conclusion that, âalthough the
Ya-lu Timber Company really appears to be
a commercial organization, its employment of
military officers of the active list to do work
that has military importance undoubtedly gives
to it a politico-military aspect.â The council,
therefore, in order to deprive Japan of a pretext
for looking upon the Timber Company as an
enterprise of a military-political character, acknowledged
the necessity of âat once taking
measures to give the affair an exclusively commercial
character, to exclude from it officers of
the regular army, and to commit the management
of the timber business to persons not employed
in the service of the Empire.â On
July&nbsp;7 these conclusions were signed by all the
members of the council, including State Councillor
Bezobrazoff. I declined to go personally
into any of the economic questions concerning
Manchuria, and said that the proper person to
do this was the Minister of Finance. State
Secretary Bezobrazoff was asked to work out the
following points with the assistance of experts
selected by him:</p>

<p>1. âWhat action should be taken and what
economic policy should be followed in Manchuria
in order to reduce the deficit on the
Eastern Chinese Railway.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>2. âTo what extent the measures for increasing
the revenue of the line and the economic
policy in Manchuria, recommended by the experts,
would affect the economic situation of the
Pri-Amur region.â</p>

<p>Another duty entrusted to this sub-committee
was the compilation of a list of all the private
enterprises which were being carried on in
Manchuria. At the last meeting of the council
on July&nbsp;11 the sub-committeeâs report on
the economic question was read out, and it
was decided âto take note of its conclusions
without discussion, and to attach them to the
councilâs proceedings.â Admiral Alexeieff suggested
that to this should be added the words,
âso that when considering the question of the
further economic development in Manchuria, we
should endeavour not to invest more State
moneys in it.â This addition was supported by
all the members of the council, excepting State
Councillor Bezobrazoff, who did not feel himself
able to offer an opinion on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> No
other conclusions on economic questions generally
or any other enterprises in Manchuria were
signed by the members of the council at Port
Arthur, and matters of an economic nature were
not looked into.</p>

<p>It is evident, from the facts above set forth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that the statement in which M. Roslavleff
charges the members of the council with signing
minutes of proceedings that gave the Bezobrazoff
adventure a place among useful Imperial
enterprises is fiction. Upon what it was based
we do not know. The duty of immediately
carrying into effect the conclusions of the councilâto
put an end immediately to the military-political
activity of the timber enterprise on the
Ya-luârested upon Admiral Alexeieff, by virtue
of the authority given to him. The thing that
he had to do, first of all, and that he was fully
empowered to do, was to recall our force from
Feng-huang-cheng, and the mounted rifles from
the Ya-lu. Why this was not done I do not
know. Personally, I did not allow Lieutenant-Colonel
Madritoff, of the General Staff, to continue
his connection with the Timber Company,
and I may add that he and other officers who had
associated themselves with the enterprise did so
without my knowledge. But no matter how
effective might be the measures taken by
Admiral Alexeieff to give the Ya-lu enterprise
a purely commercial character, I still feared
that this undertaking, which had obtained
world-wide notoriety, would continue to have
important political significance. In my report
of August&nbsp;6, 1903, which was presented to the
Emperor upon my return from Japan, I therefore
expressed the opinion that an immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
end must be put to the operations of the Timber
Company, and that the whole business should
be sold to foreigners. The thought that our
interests in Korea, which were of trifling importance,
might bring us into conflict with
Japan caused me incessant anxiety during my
stay in the latter country. On June&nbsp;26, 1903,
when I was passing through the Sea of Japan
on my way to Nagasaki, I made the following
note in my diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âIf I were asked to express an opinion, from
a military point of view, upon the comparative
importance of Russian interests in different parts
of the Empire, and on different frontiers, I
should put my judgment into the form of a
pyramidal diagram, placing the least important
of our interests at the top and the most important
at the bottom, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Pyramid of interests" class="noborder" width="450px" height="auto"
       src="images/pyramid.jpg" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>âThis diagram shows clearly where the principal
energies of the Ministry of War should
hereafter be concentrated, and in what direction
in future Russiaâs main powers and resources
should be turned. The interests that lie at the
foundation of our position as a nation are:
(1) The defence of the territorial integrity of
the Empire against the Powers of the Triple
Alliance; and (2) the employment of the forces
of all our military districts for the preservation
of internal peace and order. In comparison with
these tasks all the others have secondary importance.
The diagram shows, furthermore, that
our interests in the Pri-Amur region must be
regarded as more important than our interests in
Manchuria, and that the latter must take precedence
of our interests in Korea. I am afraid,
however, that, for a time at least, our national
activity will be based on affairs in the Far East,
and, if so, the pyramid will then be turned
bottom upwards, and made to stand on its
narrow Korean top. But such a structure on
such a foundation will fall. Columbus solved
the problem of making an egg stand on its end
by breaking the egg. Must we, in order to make
our pyramid stand on its narrow Korean end,
break the Russian Empire?â</p></div>

<p>Upon my return from Japan I showed the
above diagram to M. de Witte, who agreed
that it was correct. Notwithstanding the disastrous
conclusion to the recent war, we did not
adopt Columbusâs method. Russia is not yet
broken; but undoubtedly, now that the war is
over, the above diagram must be considerably
altered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The establishment of the Viceroyalty in the
Far East was for me a complete surprise. On
August&nbsp;15, 1903, I asked the Emperor to relieve
me of my duty as Minister of War, and after the
great manÅuvres I was granted long leave of
absence, of which I availed myself, expecting
that my place would be filled by the appointment
of some other person. In September,
1903, the state of affairs in the Far East began
to be alarming, and Admiral Alexeieff was definitely
ordered to take all necessary measures to
avoid war. The Emperor expressed his wish to
this effect with firmness, and did not, in any
way, limit or restrict the concessions that should
be made in order to avoid a rupture with Japan.
All that had to be done was to find a method
of making these concessions as little injurious as
possible to Russian interests. During my stay
in Japan, I became satisfied that the Japanese
Government was disposed to consider Japanese
and Korean affairs calmly, with a view to arriving
at an agreement upon the basis of mutual concessions.
The Emperorâs definitely expressed
desire that war should not be allowed to take
place had, for a short time, a tranquillizing effect
on Far Eastern affairs. In view of the disturbing
situation in the Far East, I cut short my
leave of absence, and, in reporting to the
Emperor for duty, I gave this threatening state
of affairs as my reason for returning. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
October&nbsp;23, 1903, the Emperor made the following
marginal note upon my letter: âThe alarm
in the Far East is apparently beginning to subside.â
In October I recommended that the
garrison at Vladivostok should be strengthened,
but permission to reinforce it was not given.
Meanwhile there was really no re-establishment
of tranquillity in the Far East, and our relations
with Japan and China were becoming more and
more involved. On October&nbsp;28, 1903, I presented
to the Emperor a special report on the
Manchurian question, in which I showed that, in
order to avoid complications with China and a
rupture with Japan, we must put an end to our
military occupation of Southern Manchuria, and
confine our activity and our administrative supervision
to the northern part of that territory.</p>

<p>At the time when this report was presented,
and laterâin Novemberâthe negotiations that
Admiral Alexeieff was carrying on with Japan
not only made no progress, but became more
critical, the Admiral still believing that to show
a yielding disposition would only make matters
worse.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the clearly expressed will of
the Emperor that all necessary measures should
be taken to avoid war, and not expecting favourable
results from Alexeieffâs negotiations, I submitted
to His Majesty, on December&nbsp;6, 1903, a
second memorandum on the Manchurian question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in which I proposed that we should restore
Port Arthur and the province of Kuan-tung to
China, and sell the southern branch of the
Eastern Chinese Railway, securing, in lieu thereof,
certain special rights in the northern part of
Manchuria. In substance, this proposition was
that we should admit the untimeliness of our
attempt to get an outlet on the Pacific, and
abandon it altogether. The sacrifice might seem
a heavy one to make, but I showed the necessity
for it by emphasizing two important considerations.
In the first place, by surrendering Port
Arthur (which had been taken away from the
Japanese), and by giving up Southern Manchuria
(with the Ya-lu enterprise), we should
escape the danger of a rupture with Japan
and China; in the second place, we should
avoid the possibility of internal disturbances in
European Russia. A war with Japan would
be extremely unpopular, and would increase
the feeling of dissatisfaction with the ruling
authorities.</p>

<p>At the end of this memorandum occurred the
following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe economic interests of Russia in the Far
East are negligible. We have as yet, thank
God, no overproduction in manufactures, because
our domestic markets are not yet glutted.
There may be some export of articles from our
factories and foundries, but it is largely bounty-fed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and will ceaseâor nearly ceaseâwhen such
artificial encouragement is withheld. Russia,
therefore, has not yet arrived at the pitiable
necessity of waging war in order to obtain
markets for her products. As for our other
interests in that quarter, the success or failure
of a few coal or timber enterprises in Manchuria
and Korea is not a matter of sufficient importance
to justify the risk of war. The railway-lines
built through Manchuria cannot change the
situation quickly, and the hope that these lines
will have world-wide importance as arteries of
international commerce is not likely to be soon
realized. Travellers, mails, tea and possibly
some other merchandise will go over them, but
the great masses of heavy international freight,
which alone can give such importance to a railway,
must still go by sea, on account of the heavy
railway rates. Such is not the case, however,
with local freight to supply local needs. This
the railroadâand especially the southern branchâwill
carry in increasing amount, thus deriving
most of its revenue, and, at the same time,
stimulating the growth of the country, and, in
Southern Manchuria particularly, benefiting the
Chinese population. But if we do not take
special measures to direct even local freight
to Dalny, that port is likely to suffer from the
competition of Newchuang. Port Arthur has
no value for Russia as the defence and terminus
of a railway, unless that railway is part of an
international transit route. The southern branch
of the Eastern Chinese road has commercially
onlyâor chieflyâlocal importance, and Russia
does not need to protect it by means so costly
as the fortifications of Port Arthur, a fleet of
warships, and a garrison of 30,000 men. It thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
appears that the retention of a forward position
in Kuan-tung is no more supported by economic
than it is by political and military considerations.
What, then, are the interests that may involve
us in war with Japan and China? Are such
interests important enough to justify the great
sacrifices that war will demand?</p>

<p class="tbreak">* * * * *</p>

<p>âThe Russian people are powerful, and their
faith in Divine Providence, as well as their devotion
to their Tsar and country, is unshaken. We
may trust, therefore, that if Russia is destined to
undergo the trial of war at the beginning of the
twentieth century, she will come out of it with
victory and glory. But she will have to make
terrible sacrificesâsacrifices that may long retard
the natural growth of the Empire. In the wars
that we waged in the early years of the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, the
enemy invaded our territory, and we fought for
our very existenceâmarched forth in defence of
our country and died for faith, Tsar, and Fatherland.
If, in the early years of the twentieth
century, war breaks out as the result of Far
Eastern complications, the Russian people and
the Russian army will execute the will of their
monarch with as much devotion and self-sacrifice
as ever, and will give up their lives and property
for the sake of attaining complete victory; but
they will have no intelligent comprehension of
the objects for which the war is waged. For
that reason there will be no such exaltation of
spirit, no such outburst of patriotism, as that
which accompanied the wars that we fought
either in self-defence or for objects dear to the
hearts of the people.</p>

<p>âWe are now passing through a critical period.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Internal enemies, aiming at the destruction of
the dearest and most sacred foundations of life,
are invading even the ranks of our army. Large
groups of the population have become dissatisfied,
or mentally unsettled, and disorders of various
sortsâmostly created by revolutionary propagandaâare
increasing in frequency. Cases in
which troops have to be called out to deal with
such disorders are much more common than they
were even a short time ago. Secret revolutionary
publications directed against the Government
are being more frequently found, even in the
barracks. &hellip; We must hope, however, that
this evil has not yet taken deep root in Russian
soil, and that by strict and wise measures it may
be eradicated. If Russia were attacked from
without, the people, with patriotic fervour, would
undoubtedly repudiate the false teaching of the
revolutionary propaganda, and show themselves
as ready to answer the call of their revered
monarch, and to defend their Tsar and country,
as they were in the early years of the eighteenth
and particularly in the nineteenth century. If,
however, they are asked to make great sacrifices
in order to carry on a war whose objects are not
clearly understood by them, the leaders of the
anti-Government party will take advantage of
the opportunity to spread sedition. Thus there
will be introduced a new factor which, if we
decide on war in the Far East, we must take
into account. The sacrifices and dangers that
we have experienced, or that we anticipate, as
results of the position we have taken in the Far
East, ought to be a warning to us when we dream
of getting an outlet on the warm waters of the
Indian Ocean at Chahbar.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It is already evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
that the British are preparing to meet us there.
The building of a railroad across Persia, the construction
of a defended port and the maintenance
of a fleet, etc., will simply be a repetition of our
experience with the Eastern Chinese Railway and
Port Arthur. In the place of Port Arthur we
shall have Chahbar, and instead of war with
Japan, we shall have a still more unnecessary
and still more terrible war with Great Britain.</p>

<p>âIn view of the considerations above set forth,
the questions arise: Ought we not to avoid the
present danger at Port Arthur, as well as the
future danger in Persia? Ought we not to
restore Kuan-tung, Port Arthur, and Dalny to
China, give up the southern branch of the Eastern
Chinese Railway, and get from China, in place
of it, certain rights in Northern Manchuria and a
sum of, say, Â£25,000,000 as compensation for
expenses incurred by us in connection with the
railway and Port Arthur?â</p></div>

<p>Copies of this report were sent to the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance, and
Admiral Alexeieff. Unfortunately, my views
were not approved, and meanwhile the negotiations
with Japan had been dragging along and
becoming more and more involved. The future
historian, who will have access to all the documents,
may be able, from a study of them, to
determine why the will of the Russian monarch
to avoid war with Japan was not carried into
effect by his principal subordinates. At present
it is only possible to state definitely that, although
neither the Emperor nor Russia desired war, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
did not succeed in escaping it. The reason for
the failure of the negotiations is evidently to be
found in our ignorance of Japanâs readiness for
war, and her determination to support her contentions
with armed force. We ourselves were
not ready to fight, and resolved that it should
not come to fighting. We made demands, but
we had no intention of using weapons to enforce
themâand, it may be added, they were not
worth going to war about. We always thought,
moreover, that the question whether there should
be war or peace depended upon us, and we
wholly overlooked Japanâs stubborn determination
to enforce demands that had for her such
vital importance, and also her reliance upon our
military unreadiness. Thus the negotiations were
not carried on by the respective parties under
equal conditions.</p>

<p>Again, our position at this period was made
worse by the form that Admiral Alexeieff gave
to the negotiations entrusted to him. Japanese
pride was offended, and the whole correspondence
became strained and difficult as a result of
the Admiralâs unfamiliarity with diplomatic procedure
and his lack of competent staff assistance.
He proceeded, moreover, upon the mistaken
assumption that it was necessary to display inflexibility
and tenacity. His idea was that one concession
would inevitably lead to another, and
that a yielding policy would be more likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
bring about a rupture in the end than a policy
of firmness.</p>

<p>The paper <i>Nasha Jizn</i>, on July&nbsp;4, 1905, published
an article entitled âThe Viceroy Alexeieffâs
Firm Policy,â which was circulated all over the
world. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âNow, when the disasters which have befallen
our operations by land and sea, together with all
the terrible, incredible sufferings of our soldiers
and sailors, are turning our thoughts to the persons
responsible for the wretched war, we must
remember, in deciding the extent to which different
departments and persons were responsible
for the âpreliminary events,â that Russian interests
in the Far East were represented by the
Viceroy, who was intimately acquainted with all
the political circumstances, and who must be
considered an authority on Far Eastern affairs.</p>

<p>âAdmiral Alexeieffâs policy was âfirm,â and all
his endeavours were directed to prevent Russiaâs
political position in those regions being weakened,
and it was on this account that he did not feel
able to recommend the evacuation of Manchuria
after it had been occupied for three years. Notwithstanding
the absolute necessity for making
concessions, he reported in September, 1903, that
the Japanese proposal was âquite an impossible
pretension,â that it must be definitely laid down
as a preliminary to any negotiations with Japan
that we should continue in occupation of Manchuria,
and that he âwas firmly convincedâ that
this was the only settlement in accordance with
our position in the Far East.</p>

<p>âThe opinion of the late Viceroy, âbasedâ on
the general political situation, was such that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
successful issue to the negotiations could only be
âexpectedâ if the Japanese Government were
clearly given to understand that Russia was
determined to support her rights and interests in
Manchuria by force of arms. With this idea,
and owing to the âprovocative action of the
Japanese,â Alexeieff proposed a whole series of
measures, amongst which was one that we should
at once attack them on the sea in the event of a
landing at Chemulpo, Chinampo, or the mouth
of the Ya-lu. He was âdeeply convincedâ that,
in order to arrive at an agreement with Japan,
the most important thing was âan inflexible resolution
and timely action, which alone can prevent
Japan realizing her extraordinarily ambitious
intentions.â</p>

<p>âWhen, in December, 1903, the Japanese
Government presented their proposals in reply
to the draft agreement drawn up by Alexeieff,
and described by him as âan honourable retreat
for her from a position which she has herself
created by her arrogant behaviour,â he characterized
these as being âequivalent to a demand
that the Russian Government should formally
acknowledge Japanâs protectorate over Korea.â
Indeed, he considered the requests made by
her âso presumptuous that we should at once
reject them.â In presenting such requests, he
said, âJapan exceeds the limit of all reason,â
and he consequently felt that no concession
was possible, and that it would be better to
break off negotiations, after clearly explaining
that in her proposals Russia âhad reached the
extreme limit of concession.â Then, when the
Japanese began to occupy Korea at the end of
December, 1903, Alexeieff represented most
strongly that âfor self-defence corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
steps should be taken to maintain the balance of
power upset by the occupation of Koreaââ<i>i.e.</i>,
that the lower reaches of the Ya-lu should be
occupied, and the mobilization of the Far Eastern
districts and the province of Siberia should be
carried out. He was of opinion that Japanâs
final proposals, received in the middle of January,
1904, were âin tone and substance still more pretentious
and bold than before,â and he insisted
on the negotiations being broken off, asserting
that their continuation âcould not lead to a settlement
of mutual interests,â and that âany display
of yielding on our part would lead to a great
loss of dignity to Russia and to a corresponding
augmentation of the prestige of Japan in the
eyes of the whole East.â</p>

<p>âThis was three weeks before the diplomatic
negotiations were broken off. Has Russiaâs
dignity not yet suffered in full measure?</p>

<p>âFinally, our last answer to Japanâdespatched
only a few days before the declaration of warâwhich
contained a refusal to consider a neutral
zone, and admitted Japanâs right to predominate
in Korea, was stated to be âan exhibition of generosity
beyond which Russia could scarcely go.â</p>

<p>âAfter three or four daysâ<i>i.e.</i>, on February&nbsp;6,
1904âdiplomatic relations were broken off
by Japan, and so began that awful war which
might have been prevented without loss of dignity
to us if the Viceroyâs policy had been a little
less âfirm,â andâit must be addedâa little less
eccentric.â</p></div>

<p>My opinions with regard to the relative importance
of the tasks which confronted our War
Department made me a convinced opponent of
an active Asiatic policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Realizing our military unreadiness on our
western frontier, and taking into account the
urgent need of devoting our resources to the
work of internal reorganization and reform, I
thought that a rupture with Japan would be a
national calamity, and did everything in my power
to prevent it. Throughout my long service in
Asia I had not only been an advocate of an
agreement with Great Britain on that continent,
but I was also certain that a peaceable delimitation
of spheres of influence between us and Japan
was possible.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the carrying of the main
line of the Trans-Siberian Railway through Manchuria
was a mistake. I had nothing to do with
the adoption of that route, as I was then Commander
of the Trans-Caspian Military District;
it was also contrary to the opinion of General
Dukhovski, representative of the War Department
in the Far East.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="center skip1">WHY THE JAPANESE WERE SUCCESSFUL</p>

<p class="noindent">The army we put in the field was unable to defeat
the Japanese in the time allotted to it. Many
historians will probably essay to solve the riddle of
how a Power, which we regarded as belonging to
the second class, and one which not long ago possessed
no army, was able to crush us absolutely on
the sea, and to defeat a strong force on land, and
doubtless we shall eventually be furnished with
the reasons in full. For the present I propose to
mention only some general causes which contributed
to Japanâs success. Broadly speaking, we
underestimated her power, particularly her moral
strength, and entered upon the war far too lightly.</p>

<p>The Japanese first became our neighbours
when we occupied Kamchatka in the reign of
Peter the Great. In 1860, after the peaceful
occupation of the extensive Ussuri regionâby
virtue of the Treaty of Pekingâwe moved down
to the frontier of Korea and the Sea of Japan.
This sea, which is almost completely enclosed by
Korea and the Japanese Islands, is of immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
importance to the whole of the adjacent coasts,
and as the outlets from it into the ocean were in
her hands, Japan might have easily prevented
our obtaining free access to the Pacific. But, by
our acquisition of Saghalien, we gained an outlet
through Tartar Strait.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This, however, was
frequently and for long periods icebound, and
for about forty years the only spot developed on
the Ussuri coast was Vladivostok. Our new
neighbour did not attract any attention from us
for a long timeâso long, in fact, as her life did not
come into contact with oursâand we remained
confident of her military weakness. We knew the
Japanese as skilful and patient artisans; we were
fond of their productions, of which the delicate
workmanship and brilliant colouring charmed us;
our sailors spoke with appreciation of the country
and its inhabitants, and were full of pleasant
reminiscences of their visits, especially of Nagasaki,
where they appeared to be popular with the
inhabitants; but as a military factor Japan did
not exist. Our sailors, travellers, and diplomats,
had entirely overlooked the awakening of an
energetic, independent people.</p>

<div class="caption">H.I.M. THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1867 the armed forces of Japan consisted
of 10,000 men, organized in nine battalions, two
squadrons, and eight batteries. This force, which
constituted the cadre of the standing army, was
trained by French instructors, from whom, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the troops obtained the pattern of their uniform.
In 1872, as a result of the Franco-German War,
Japan was subjected to the law of universal
service; the French instructors were replaced by
Germans, who organized the army according to
German ideas, and officers were sent every year
to Europe to study their profession. At the
time of the Chino-Japanese War the army consisted
of seven infantry divisions; but, being
prevented from enjoying the fruits of her victories
in this war by reason of her weakness both on
land and sea, the nation strained every nerve to
create an army and navy capable of protecting
its interests. On April 1, 1896, the Mikado
issued a decree for the reorganization of the
military forces, by which the strength of the
army would be doubled in seven years. In 1903
this reorganization was completed. Statistically
the creation and growth of this great naval and
military force were not overlooked by us; the
construction of every warship and the formation
of every new division of infantry was mentioned
in the reports of our Navy and War Departments.
But we did not properly appreciate the
meaning of these beginnings, and were unable to
gauge the fighting value of the mere numbers by
any European standard. Detailed information
as to the organization and strength of the army,
with an appreciation of its technical preparedness
and capability of mobilization, was compiled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a handbook by the Headquarter Staff and revised
annually. This book contained the following
figures as to the strength of the Japanese troops
which took part in the Chinese War of 1894â95,
and in the expedition in 1900 to the province of
Pei-chih-li:</p>

<p>1. <i>War with China, 1894â95.</i>âIn this war
Japan was forced to put forward the whole of
her military strength. Each of the seven
divisions which then existed were mobilized and
despatched from Hiroshima to the theatre of
war as operations developed. Half of the
5th&nbsp;Division was sent to Korea in the middle of
June before war had actually been declared,
followed in August, after hostilities had commenced,
by the other half and the whole of
the 3rd&nbsp;Division. These two divisions constituted
the 1st&nbsp;Army, which defeated the
Chinese forces at Pingyang in September, forced
the passage of the Ya-lu in October, and moved
on Mukden through South-East Manchuria.
After a naval engagement at the mouth of the
River Ya-lu, the 2nd&nbsp;Army, consisting of the
1st Division and half of the 6th, was, by September&nbsp;30,
concentrated at Hiroshima. This army
landed north of Pi-tzu-wo, and fought its way
into Port Arthur. Towards the end of 1894,
three and a half divisions, of a total strength
of 52,600 men, were in Southern Manchuria.
In the beginning of 1895, the 2nd Division and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the other half of the 6th Division were landed
on the Shan-tung Peninsula; these troops composed
the 3rd Army, numbering about 24,000
men. Thus, by the beginning of 1895, more than
75,000 men had been landed in China. Thirty
vessels of a steamship company, subsidized by
the Japanese Government, were chartered for the
conveyance of these troops. On account of the
roughness of the country in the theatre of war
the land transport consisted mostly of carriers
organized into corps, the majority of whom
were recruited in Japan; the remainder were
coolies collected in Korea and Manchuria. For
the preliminary expenses of the war the Japanese
Treasury allotted Â£4,500,000; later, an internal
loan of Â£15,000,000 was raised. When the
whole of the extraordinary expenditure was
totalled, it was estimated that the war cost
Japan about Â£20,000,000, of which Â£16,420,000
was chargeable to the War Department and
Â£3,580,000 to the Navy Department.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Expedition to China in 1900.</i>âAt first,
a force of three battalions, one squadron, and one
company of sappersâtotal 3,000 menâof the
5th&nbsp;and 11th&nbsp;Divisions was mobilized in July,
followed about a month later by the mobilization
of the 5th&nbsp;Division. The troops were conveyed
to Ta-ku in twenty-one transports, chartered from
the Nippon-Yusen-Kaisha.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Excluding the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
force, 19,000 men in all were taken (the whole
of the 5th&nbsp;Division, the Zopoleff batteries, part
of the railway battalion from Tokio, and 6,000
to 7,000 hired coolies wearing uniform). Altogether,
22,000 men were transportedâthe
5th Division with its units and cooliesâand all
the supplies were sent from Japan. During the
whole time, about 6,000 sick and wounded were
returned to the base, while one-half of the
cavalry and artillery and three-quarters of the
transport horses died. The cost of the expedition,
estimated at Â£3,800,000 to Â£4,000,000, was taken
from the fund of some Â£5,000,000 set aside for
the construction of warships and emergency
expenditure. Within seven years of the war of
1894â95 Japan had almost doubled her armed
forces, and was very largely enabled to do this by
the war indemnity received from China, the payment
of which was made through our mediation.</p>

<p>The strength of the Japanese army, before the
war with us, was calculated by our Headquarter
Staff to be as follows:</p>

<p>The peace strength of the standing army
(excluding the garrison of Formosa) was estimated
at 8,116 officers and 133,457 men. For economy,
however, only 6,822 officers and 110,000 men were
actually with the colours in peace, and of these,
about 13,500 were continually on furlough. The
war strength was fixed at 10,735 officers (without
depÃ´t troops) and 348,074 men. Thus, to bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the peace numbers up to the war establishment,
about 3,900 officers and 240,000 more men were
required. On January&nbsp;1, 1901, there were in the
standing army, reserve, and territorial forces a
total of 2,098 staff and general officers, 8,755
regimental and warrant officers, 35,248 non-commissioned
officers, 6,964 second-lieutenants
and <i>yunkers</i>, and 273,476 men, a total of 10,853
officers and 315,688 men.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Taking the peace
establishment of the standing army at 8,116
officers and about 110,000 men, it is evident that
on January&nbsp;1, 1901, there were 2,737 officers and
about 205,000 men in the reserve and territorial
forces. Comparing these numbers with those
required to bring the peace establishment up to
war strength, we find that on January&nbsp;1, 1901,
the numbers could not have been obtained; that
there was a shortage of officers equal to those
required for the reserve troops,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and a shortage
of some 35,000 men. Taking into consideration
the probable yearly contingent of recruits
(45,000 men), and also the periods of service in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the different classes of troops, it may be said that
by January&nbsp;1, 1903, the number of men in the
reserve and territorial forces was approximately
265,000.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Finally, to complete the army in an
emergency, some 50,000 men were obtainable
from the reserve of recruits, the majority of
whom were quite untrained. No mention has
been yet made of reserve troops, but preparations
were made for their formation, and, according to
the number of battalions, they must have increased
the standing army by two-thirds of its
establishment. The latest information prior to
the war which we had of the strength, organization,
and training of the Japanese army was
based on the reports of our military attachÃ© in
Japan, Colonel Vannovski, of the General Staff.
Colonel Adabash, who visited Japan in 1903,
forwarded to General Jilinski, of the Headquarter
Staff, very important information as to the
reserve units, towards whose formation steps
were then being taken; but as this information
differed completely from that sent by Colonel
Vannovski, Major-General Jilinski unfortunately
did not consider it reliable. Some months later,
Captain Rusin, our naval attachÃ© in that country,
an extremely able officer, forwarded to the Headquarter
Staff of the navy very much the same
information as that furnished by Adabash. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
report was transmitted by the Navy Department
to General Sakharoff, Chief of the Headquarter
Staff. It was ascertained later that both these
reports were quite accurate, but that they had
been pigeon-holed because neither General
Jilinski nor General Sakharoff believed them.
Consequently, the information in the printed
handbooks as to the Japanese armed forces in
1903â04 did not include a single word as to
reserves. Similarly, we did not attach a proper
value to their numerous depÃ´t troops. According
to our calculations, based on information sent
in by our military attachÃ©s in Japan, the available
supply of men for the permanent and territorial
armies and for the depÃ´t troops amounted only
to a little over 400,000.</p>

<p>The official figures as to the Japanese War
casualties have now been published by the
principal medical officer of the Japanese army,
Surgeon-General Kipke. From these it appears
that their losses amounted to: killed, 47,387;
wounded, 172,425âtotal, 219,812. The total
killed, wounded, and sick amounted to 554,885
[a considerably greater number than the total we
thought they could put in the field against us],
and 320,000 sick and wounded were sent back
to Japan. From other sources we now know
that they buried 60,624 killed in the Cemetery
of Honour in Tokio, and that 74,545 besides
died from wounds and sickness. They must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
admit, therefore, to 135,000 killed and dead.
As Surgeon-General Kipke states that the killed
and wounded amounted to 14Â·58 per cent. of
their total strength, it would appear that the
total number of troops put in the field against
us was over 1,500,000, or was more than three
times the number anticipated by our Headquarter
Staff. In view of these facts, it is
evident that our information as to their fighting
strength was incorrect. As an instance of the
neglect, referred to in the preceding paragraph,
to take any account of the formation of reserve
units, a scheme drawn up in Port Arthur in
November, 1903, for the strategical distribution
of our troops in the Far East in the event of
complications, estimated the numbers that Japan
could place against us as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âAt the beginning of hostilities, when her
territorial army is not completely organized, out
of her 13 field divisions, she will only be able to
put 9 divisions of a strength of 120 infantry
battalions, 46 squadrons of cavalry, 10 engineer
battalions, and 1 siege battalionâa total of
125,000 combatantsâin the field.â</p></div>

<p>This calculation agrees with the reports furnished
in 1903 by our military attachÃ© in Japan, Lieutenant-Colonel
Samoiloff, of the General Staff,
who informed me, when I was in Japan, that
they could only put in the field 10 divisions out
of 13; of the reserve troops he knew nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Again, in a memorandum written in the Operations
Branch of the Headquarter Staff, and
submitted to me by the Chief of the General
Staff on February&nbsp;12, 1904, it was stated that,
according to available information, the Japanese
could put 11 of their 13 divisions in the field,
leaving 2 in Japan. In this memorandum, again,
no mention was made of the reserve units.</p>

<p>The readiness of their army for mobilization,
owing to their adoption of a territorial system,
and the consequent short distances the depÃ´t
troops had to travel, was known to be very complete.
We knew that the troops could complete
their mobilization in three or four days, while the
supply and other departments would require
seven to ten. Information as to transports
available showed that even in 1902 they could
have collected in seven days 86 ships with an
aggregate displacement of 224,000 tons, and in
fourteen days 97 ships with a displacement
of 268,000. For a mobilized division about
40,000 tons are required for a journey of more
than forty-eight hours, while 20,000 tons would
suffice for a journey of less than forty-eight hours.
Thus the tonnage available was sufficient to
allow embarkation to be commenced at once on
completion of mobilization of six divisions for a
journey of not more than forty-eight hours, or
of almost the whole army for a lesser distance.</p>

<p>As regards the tactical readiness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Japanese before the war, our people in Manchuria
did receive certain information. The
operations of large bodies of their troops of all
arms had been commented upon by our Headquarter
Staff as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe most noticeable points in the operations
of bodies consisting of all three arms as seen at
the manÅuvres wereâ</p>

<p>â1. The inclination to take up too extended
defensive positions.</p>

<p>â2. A hard-and-fast, inelastic form of attack
independent of local conditions.</p>

<p>â3. The absence of proper flank protection
both on the march and in action.</p>

<p>â4. The tendency, when on the move, to keep
the main body too far from the advance guard,
which would in consequence have to fight unsupported
for a long time.</p>

<p>â5. The absence of a definite objective in the
attack.</p>

<p>â6. The tendency to use up reserves too
quickly. As a result, there are frequently no
troops with which to meet turning and enveloping
movements.</p>

<p>â7. The disbelief in cold steel.</p>

<p>â8. The inclination to avoid enclosed and, in
particular, hilly ground.</p>

<p>â9. The inclination to use direct frontal
attacks without turning movements.</p>

<p>â10. The neglect of field fortifications in the
defence; infantry fire trenches, gun-pits and
epaulements alone are made.</p>

<p>â11. The complete absence of any idea of
pursuit.</p>

<p>â12. The tendency to retire too rapidly: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
infantry of the main body withdraws first; this is
followed by the whole of the guns, and then the
remaining infantry.</p>

<p>â13. The disinclination for night operations.</p>

<p>â14. The absence of contact between divisions:
each division operates independently without
keeping in touch with others; this is due to the
lack of general control by the officer in chief
command.</p>

<p>âIn reviewing their own operations against
China in 1900, the Japanese Press expressed the
opinion that the operations of small bodies were
excellently carried out, but that the troops, if
operating in force, would probably be considerably
inferior to Europeans. In the last grand
autumn manÅuvres in 1903 it was noticed that
the troops were well trained. Considerable initiative
was observed amongst the junior officers,
which was more than could be said of the seniors;
great interest was taken in the work, and everything
was very thoroughly done. The technical
services were excellent. The artillery and infantry
manÅuvred well; the cavalry were learning
to ride, and appeared keen, but the generals
did not know how to use cavalry, and employed
it little; the instruction, however, was good.
The thing which most attracted attention was
the rapidity with which the mountain artillery
came into action. On being ordered out from
column of route, they got into action and opened
fire in three and a half minutes.â</p></div>

<p>From the above remarks it may be gathered
how badly the officers, to whom was entrusted
the duty of studying the Japanese troops on the
spot, carried out this duty; particularly faulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
was their deduction regarding the inability of
the senior officers to command in war.</p>

<p>After the war with China, which ended in the
expulsion of the Japanese from the Liao-tung
Peninsula and our occupation of Kuan-tung,
they began to prepare in haste for war with us.
From a little more than Â£2,000,000 in 1893,
1894, and 1895, their military Budget rose in
1896 to Â£7,300,000, in 1897 to Â£10,300,000, and
in 1900 to Â£13,300,000. In 1902 all her preparations
were apparently complete, and the
Budget again fell to Â£7,500,000. Of the expenses
incurred from 1896 to 1902 on increases to the
forces, the War Department spent Â£4,800,000,
and the Navy Department spent in nine years
Â£13,800,000 [in building ships for the fleet]. It
should be added that, while developing her forces,
Japan was in other ways preparing for hostilities.
A number of officers were sent to study their
profession in Europe, including our own country,
and the probable theatre of operations was investigated
with great care, reconnaissances being
organized in every direction. At great self-sacrifice
also many officers were performing the
most menial duties in our employ in the Far East
in order to study our ways at a time when our
military representatives in Japan were looking
upon their nation with immense condescension!</p>

<p>As regards the organization of their forces, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
information was sufficiently complete regarding
everything which concerned the standing army;
we also knew the number of depÃ´t troops and
the supposed dispositions of the territorial forces.
But, while ourselves preparing to fight the
Japanese with an army half composed of reserve
troops, we never suspected that they, too,
were organizing a great formation of reserve
units, and that, owing to our slow concentration,
they would be able to complete this formation.
Amongst their reserve troops were men of all
classes, and while our âsecond categoryâ men
constituted, according to our generals in the
field, an element of particular weakness, their reserve
soldiers, thanks to the patriotism and the
martial spirit which permeated all ranks, fought
not only no worse than their regulars, but in
some cases better.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The appearance of their
reserve units in the first battles was indeed a
complete surprise for us. Nor did we properly
appreciate the organization of their strong depÃ´t
units, which enabled every regiment of the
standing army to have its depÃ´t battalion, from
which its wastage was uninterruptedly and
quickly made good. Later, many of these battalions
received extra companies, which brought
them up to a strength of over 1,500 men, and
some were moved into Manchuria and stationed
close to the field troops. I fancy, also, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
they were occasionally even used in the fieldâfor
instance, in protecting portions of positions which
had been vacated by the field armyâbut their
main function, that of repairing the wastage of
men, was very successfully performed. The
army possessed fewer battalions than we had,
but they were kept up to strength even during
a series of battles, and were usually superior in
numbers to ours. Generally speaking, each
Japanese battalion, taking the number of rifles,
was equal to one and a half, and sometimes two
and three, of ours. With us, on the contrary,
the replacement of casualties was very fitful and
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Though our information as to the material
points of the enemyâs strength can hardly be
described as good, we very much underestimatedâif
we did not entirely overlookâits moral side.
We paid no attention to the fact that for many
years the education of the Japanese people had
been carried out in a martial spirit and on
patriotic lines. We saw nothing in the educational
methods of a country where the children
in the elementary schools are taught to love
their nation and to be heroes. The nationâs
belief in and deep respect for the army, the individualâs
willingness and pride in serving, the
iron discipline maintained among all ranks, and
the influence of the <i>samurai</i> spirit, escaped our
notice, while we attached no importance to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
intense feeling of resentment that we aroused
when we deprived the Japanese of the fruits of
their victories in China. We never recognized
how vital the Korean question was to them, and
that the âYoung Japaneseâ party had long ago
determined to fight us, and was only restrained
by the wise action of their Government. True,
when hostilities began we did see all these things,
but it was too late. And at that time, when the
war was neither popular with, nor understood by,
our nation, the whole manhood of Japan was
responding with unanimous enthusiasm to the
call to arms. There were instances of mothers
committing suicide when their sons were rejected
for the army on medical grounds. A call for
volunteers for a forlorn hope produced hundreds
ready to face certain death. While many officers
and men had their funeral rites performed
before leaving for the front, to show their intention
of dying for their country, those who
were taken prisoners at the commencement of
operations committed suicide. The one idea
of the youth of Japan was to serve in the
army, and all the great families tried to do
something for their country either by giving
their children to it or by providing money. This
spirit produced regiments which hurled themselves
upon our obstacles with a shout of
âBanzai!â broke through them, and throwing
the corpses of their comrades into the <i>trous de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
loup</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> climbed over them on to our works.
The nation as well as the soldiers felt the vital
importance of the war, appreciated the reasons
for which it was being fought, and spared no
sacrifices to obtain victory. In this and in
the co-operation of the nation with the army
and the Government lay the strength which
brought Japan victory. And it was with an
army weakened by the feeling of opposition
in its own country that we had to face the
armed might of such a nation!</p>

<p>While they had hundreds of secret as well as
avowed agents studying our military and naval
forces in the Far East, we entrusted the collection
of information to one officer of the General
Staff, and unfortunately our selection was bad.
One of the so-called âJapanese expertsâ declared
in Vladivostok before the war that we
might count one Russian soldier as being as
good as three Japanese. After the first few
fights he modified his tone, and acknowledged
that one Japanese soldier was as good as one
Russian. A month later he affirmed that if we
meant to win, we must put three men into the
field for every Japanese! In May, 1904, one of
our late military attachÃ©s at Tokio predicted, as
an expert, that Port Arthur would very soon fall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and Vladivostok immediately after it. I reprimanded
this cowardly babbler, and threatened
to send him away from the front if he could not
restrain his ill-timed and mischievous remarks.</p>

<p>After the Chino-Japanese War, which I had
studied with great care, I, personally, was inspired
with great respect for the Japanese army,
and I watched its growth with considerable
alarm. The behaviour of their troops which
fought alongside ours in the Pei-chih-li province
in 1900 only confirmed my opinion as to their
value. In the short time I spent in Japan itself
I was unable to get to know the country and its
troops, but what I saw was sufficient to show
me how astounding were the results attained
by the Japanese in the previous twenty-five to
thirty years. I saw a beautiful country filled
with a numerous and industrious people. Great
activity was visible on all sides, and underlying
everything could be felt the national happy
nature, love of country, and belief in the future.
The system of education I witnessed in the
Military School was of a Spartan nature, the
physical exercises of the future officers being like
nothing I had ever seen in Europe; it was really
fighting of the fiercest kind. At the end of a
bout with weapons the competitors got to hand
grips, and fought till the winner had got his
opponent down and could tear off his mask.
The exercises themselves were performed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the greatest possible keenness and determination,
the men hitting one another with wild shouts;
but the moment the combat was over or the
signal to stop was given, the usual wooden, impassive
expression again came over the faces of
the combatants. In all the schools military
exercises were very conspicuous, and the children
and boys were greatly interested in them. Even
their walks out were always enlivened by tactical
tasks adapted to the localities; turning movements
as well as surprise attacks were practised
and performed at the double. The study
of Japanese history in all the schools had
strengthened the peopleâs love for their native
land, and filled them with a deep-rooted conviction
that it was invincible. Their successes
in war were everywhere sung, the heroes of
those campaigns continually extolled, and the
children were taught that not one of Japanâs
military enterprises had ever failed. In the
small-arm factories I saw large quantities of rifles
being turned out, and the work was carried on
with rapidity, accuracy, and economy. In Kobe
and Nagasaki I inspected the shipbuilding yards,
in which the construction not only of ocean-going
destroyers, but of armoured cruisers, was
proceeding; everything was being done by
Japanese workmen under their own foremen and
engineers. The trade of the whole country was
most splendidly and instructively represented at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the Great Exhibition of Osaka, where there was
a large collection of manufactured articles of
every sort, including textiles and complicated
instruments, such as grand-pianos, engines, and
heavy ordnance. These were all made in Japan
with Japanese labour, and mainly from Japanese
materials, except in the case of raw cotton and
iron, which were imported from China and Europe.
Not less impressive than their progress in manufacture
was the orderly and dignified demeanour
of the Japanese who thronged the Exhibition.
Agriculture was still carried on in a primitive
manner, but it was very close. Though the
soil was most carefully cultivated, the keen
competition for every plot of ground, the
struggle to make even the hills productive,
and the general scarcity of food-stuffs in the
country (despite the intensive culture), showed
how crowded the population was becoming, and
how vital the Korean question was for the whole
nation. After ten days spent among the fisher
class, I got an idea of the reverse side of Japanâs
rapid development according to European ideals,
and many were the complaints made to me of the
heavy taxes, which had increased so rapidly of late,
and of the great cost of all the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>I saw some of their troops on parade (Guards
Division, two regiments of the 1st Division,
several batteries, and two cavalry regiments).
Nearly everything was excellent, and the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
marched well, and looked like our <i>yunkers</i>
but the poor quality of the horses was very
noticeable. Even after such short acquaintance,
many of the officers and men gave the impression
of being fitted by training and knowledge of
their profession to fill honourable posts in any
army. Besides the War Minister (General
Terauchi), whom I had known in 1896, when
we were both attached to the 17th&nbsp;Army Corps
at the great French manÅuvres, I met Generals
Yamagata, Oyama, Kodama, Fukushima, Nodzu,
Hasegawa, Murata, Princes Fushima, Kanin, and
others. I also met numerous leaders in other
spheres of life, among whom were Ito, Katsura,
and Kamimura, and, in spite of the sad war which
has placed a barrier between two nations that
seem created to be friends and allies, I still feel
affectionately towards my Tokio acquaintances.
I especially remember the intense love of country
and devotion to the Sovereign which permeated
all, and showed itself in their daily life. In the
report made after my visit, I stated my opinion
that the Japanese army was fully equal to the
armies of Europe; that while one of our
battalions on the defensive could hold two
Japanese battalions, we would require to be
twice as strong as they when attacking. The
test of war has shown that I was correct. There
were, of course, regrettable instances when the
Japanese, with fewer battalions than were opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to them, drove our troops from their positions;
but this was due to bad leadership on our side,
and to the inferior war-strength of our battalions.
In the latter phases of the Battle of Mukden, for
instance, some of our brigades<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> could muster
little more than 1,000 rifles. To be superior to
such a brigade the Japanese only needed two to
three battalions.</p>

<p>Everything that I saw and studied concerning
the countryâits armed forces, and its work in
the Far Eastâconvinced me how necessary it
was to come to a peaceful agreement with Japan,
even at the expense of concessions which might
at first sight appear to be derogatory to our
national self-esteem. As already stated (in
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a>), I did not hesitate to recommend
even the restoration of Kuan-tung and Port
Arthur to China, and the sale of the southern
branch of the Eastern Chinese Railway. I foresaw
that a Japanese war would be most unpopular
in Russia, and that, as the reasons for it
would not be understood by the nation, it would
find no support in national feeling, and I showed
that the anti-Government party would take
advantage of it to increase the disturbance in
the interior. But even I did not give our
enemy credit for the activity, bravery, and
intense patriotism which they exhibited, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
was, therefore, mistaken in the time I thought
that such a struggle would last. We ought to
have allowed three years for the land operations,
owing to our very inferior railway communication,
instead of the one and a half years estimated
by me. We did less than the world expected of
us, and the Japanese did more.</p>

<p>Major Emmanuel, of the German army, a
lecturer at the Military Academy at Berlin,
gives the following appreciation of the Japanese
military forces in his work on the Russo-Japanese
War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âAt the beginning of the war the Japanese
possessed an army, organized and trained
according to the German ideal, but carefully
adapted to the national peculiarities. It was
excellently armed, in a high state of efficiency,
and was commanded by a splendidly trained
corps of officers, worthy of the deepest respect.
The fleet is, however, the vital necessity of the
country, and every Japanese is a born sailor, and,
thanks to his intelligence and the practice he
gets, handles the most modern ships admirably.
Having adapted modern methods to her national
idiosyncrasies, Japan has put in the field an army
without nerves, and one that thoroughly understands
the conditions of modern war. To great
natural intelligence and aptitude for learning the
Japanese soldier adds dash, a contempt for death,
and a preference for the attack.â</p></div>

<p>The British General, Sir Ian Hamilton, who
was attached to the Japanese during the war,
states his opinion that a Japanese battalion has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
no equal in European armies. Of their characteristics
generally, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>â... and upon the patriotism which they
have absorbed with their motherâs milk, the
Government has been careful to graft initiative,
quickness, and intelligence. This is accomplished
in the schools, which keep the soldierly virtues
in the forefront of their curriculum.â<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></div>

<p class="tbreak2">* * * * *</p>

<p>With all their strong points, however, the
Japanese had weaknesses which I need not
enumerate here. There is a saying that âa
conqueror cannot be judged,â and we must bow
to the victor. I will only add that the issue of
the fighting was often in doubt and nearly in
our favour, while in some cases we only escaped
serious defeat owing to the mistakes of their
commanders.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that before the
war we underestimated Japanâs material, and
particularly her moral strength. But I will add
some further reasons for her success. Without
doubt the main rÃ´le in the war should have been
played by our fleet. The Headquarter Staffs of
the navy and army did keep a detailed account
of all Japanese warships, but our naval representatives
in the Far East made their calculations
in tons, and in the number and calibre of
guns. Having thus arrived at a statistical total,
satisfactory to us in comparison with the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
figures for our Pacific Ocean squadron, they
came to the conclusion in 1903 that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âOur plan of operations should be based on the
assumption that it is impossible for our fleet to
be beaten, taking into consideration the present
relationship of the two fleets, and that a Japanese
landing at Newchuang, and in the Gulf of
Korea, is impracticable.â</p></div>

<p>The number of men we would require on land
depended on three things:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The strength in which the Japanese might
be able to move into Manchuria and into our
territory;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The strength of our own fleet, andâ</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The carrying capacity of our railway communication.</p>

<p>Of course, had our fleet gained an initial
victory, land operations would have been unnecessary.
But, putting this aside, it was only
by actually gaining command of the sea that the
Japanese were able to denude their own coast
of defenders, and, what is still more important,
risk a landing in the Liao-tung Peninsula. Had
they been compelled to move through Korea, we
should have had time to concentrate. Having
gained a local superiority in armoured ships by
their desperate attack [before a declaration of
war] on the fleet in Port Arthur, they obtained
the temporary command of the sea, and took
advantage of it to the full; while at this, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
most crucial period of the war, our fleet did
nothing to prevent their concentration. This
was especially the case after the death of
Admiral Makharoff, when even their operations
close to Port Arthur were not hindered at all.
The consequences of this inaction were most
serious, for instead of being unable to land in
the Gulf of Korea, as had been assumed by our
Navy Department, the enemy were in a position
to threaten the whole coast of the Liao-tung
Peninsula.</p>

<p>As our troops were so few in number, Admiral
Alexeieff decided to disperse, so as to be in a
position to oppose landings at Newchuang, at
Kuan-tung, and on the Ya-lu. He also permitted
a dispersion of the fleet, with the result that we
were scattered everywhere, and too weak in
any one spot. The Japanese transport facilities
enabled them to land three armies on the Liao-tung
Peninsula and only one in Korea. Sending
one army to Port Arthur, they commenced with
the other three their advance against our Manchurian
army, which was slowly concentrating
in the Hai-cheng, Liao-yang area. Having
taken the initiative at sea, they also seized it
on land, and by their quick concentration and
advance, were enabled from the very first to
place superior numbers against us. Their consequent
success in the first engagements also
elevated their spirits as much as it depressed our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
own. They possessed immense advantages in
communication, and the transport of supplies,
which took us months, was carried out by them
quickly and easily. And, what was not less
important, a continuous stream of war materials
and supplies poured into their ports and arsenals
from Europe and America, thanks to the absolute
inaction of our fleet. Owing to our inferior
railway communication, also, Japan was able to
form a large number of new units whilst we were
slowly concentrating our army.</p>

<p>The theatre of operations in Manchuria had
been known to the Japanese since their war with
China. They were perfectly acquainted with its
climate, its rains, its mud, its hills, and the peculiarities
of <i>kao-liang</i>.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In the hills, in which
we were almost helpless, they felt at home.
Having been preparing for war for ten years,
they had not only studied the country, but had
sown it with agents, who were of immense
service to them. In spite of their severe, almost
cruel attitude, the Chinese population assisted
them greatly in their operations; and, notwithstanding
our superiority in cavalry, they generally
had good information as to our strength
and dispositions. We, on the contrary, often
operated in the dark. They were greatly
superior to us in their high explosive artillery
projectiles, their numerous mountain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
machine guns, and their abundance of explosives
and technical material, both for attack and
defence, such as wire, mines, and hand-grenades;
while their organization, equipment, and transport
were better adapted to the local conditions
than ours. They also had a greater proportion
of sapper troops than we had. Their educational
system was calculated to develop their initiative
and intelligence, and the battle instructions with
which they commenced the war were very
materially altered as it proceeded. For instance,
their original regulations did not recommend
night attacks; but they soon became convinced
of the advantages of this form of fighting, and
frequently resorted to it. Owing to the more
advanced education of their poorer classes, their
non-commissioned officers were better than ours,
many being quite fitted to take the place of
officers, and their corps of officers exhibited the
most determined bravery, foresight, and knowledge,
and wielded great authority. Even those
in the highest ranks lived simple and strict lives
at the front. But the principal thing which gave
success to the Japanese was their high moral
tone. It made victory seem worth any sacrifice,
and led directly to that determination to win
which characterized all ranks from Commander-in-Chief
to private soldier. In many cases their
forces found themselves in so desperate a plight
that either to hold their ground or to advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
required the most extraordinary effort of will.
The officers possessed the strength to ask for
this almost impossible effort; did not hesitate
to shoot men who tried to retire; the private
soldier, in response, made the effort, and thereby
often robbed us of victory. One thing is certain:
that if the whole army had not been saturated
with patriotism, if it had not felt the friendly
support of the nation behind it, if it had not
realized the supreme importance of the struggle,
the endeavours of its leaders would have been in
vain. The order to advance might have been
given, but the soldiers, unsupported by the feeling
that the country was with them, would not
have had the strength to perform feats of heroism
almost superhuman.</p>

<p class="noindent">After a succession of great battles,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> our army
retired fighting on to the so-called Hsi-ping-kai
positions in March, 1905, and remained there,
increasing in strength, till the conclusion of
peace. This peace, which was as unexpected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
as it was undesired by the troops, found them
putting the finishing touches to their preparation
for a forward movement. Later on, in its proper
place, will be described the high state of readiness
to which we had arrived in August, 1905âa
pitch of efficiency never before known in the
history of the Russian army.</p>

<p>General Linievitch was awaiting the arrival of
the 13th&nbsp;Army Corpsâthe last to be despatchedâbefore
commencing decisive operations. The
leading units of this corps had arrived at Harbin
and its rear had passed through Cheliabinsk, and
the army, now 1,000,000 strong, well organized,
with war experience to its credit, and with
established reputation, was making ready to continue
the bloody struggle; while the enemy, so
we learned from reliable reports, was beginning
to weaken both in strength and spirit. The
resources of Japan appeared to be exhausted.
Amongst the prisoners we began to find old men
and mere youths; more were taken than formerly,
and they no longer showed the patriotic
fanaticism so conspicuous among those captured
in 1904. We, on the other hand, were able to
free our ranks to a great extent of elderly
reservists by sending them to the rear and to
perform non-combatant duties; for we had
received some 100,000 young soldiers, a great
portion of whom had volunteered for the
front. For the first time since the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of hostilities the army was up to its full
strength. Some unitsâthe 7th&nbsp;Siberian Corps,
for instanceâwere over strength, so that companies
could put more than 200 rifles into the
firing-line after providing for all duties. We
had received machine-guns, howitzer batteries,
and a stock of field railway material which made
it possible to transport to the army the supplies
which had been collecting for some months.
We possessed telegraphs, telephones, wire and
cable, toolsâeverything. A wireless installation
had been put up, and was in working order;
the transport units were up to strength, and the
medical arrangements were magnificent. The
force was in occupation of the strongly fortified
Hsi-ping-kai positions, between which and the
Sungari River there were two more fortified defensive
linesâKung-chu-ling and Kuang-cheng-tzu.
There is little doubt that we could have repulsed
any advance of the enemy, and, according to our
calculations, could have assumed the offensive
in superior force. Never in the whole of her
military history has Russia put such a mighty
army in the field as that formed by the concentration
of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Manchurian
Armies in August, 1905.</p>

<p>Such were the favourable conditions existing
when we suddenly received the fatal news that
an agreement had been come to with Japan at
Portsmouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the war ended too
soon for Russia, and before Japan had beaten
the army which was opposed to her. After
defending every yard, we had retired to Hsi-ping-kai,
and were, after a yearâs fighting, still
in Southern Manchuria. The whole of Northern
Manchuria, including Harbin and part of
Southern Manchuria, with Kirin and Kuang-cheng-tzu,
was still in our hands, and the enemy
had nowhere touched Russian territory, except in
Saghalien. Yet we laid down our arms, and besides
ceding half the Island of Saghalien to the enemy,
literally presented themâwhat was strategically
far more importantâwith the Hsi-ping-kai
and Kung-chu-ling defensive lines, together
with the fertile districts which had fed our hosts,
and it was with mixed feelings of shame and bewilderment
that we withdrew in October, 1905,
into winter quarters on the Sungari River.
None of the many misfortunes which had befallen
us had such an evil effect on our troops
as this premature peace. Upon assuming command,
I had assured the army that not a man
would be allowed to return to Russia until we
were victorious, that without victory we would
all be ashamed to show our faces at home, and
the men had really become imbued with the
idea that the war must be continued till we won.
This was even recognized by the reservists, many
of whom said to me: âIf we return home beaten,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the women will laugh at us.â Such a sentiment
is, of course, not as valuable as a wave of
patriotism and a display of martial spirit before
hostilities; but under the conditions in which
this war had to be conducted, the mere acknowledgment
by the whole army that without
victory a return to Russia was impossible
augured well for any future fighting. Such,
then, being the conditions, the future historian
must admit that, although unsuccessful in the
first campaign, our land forces had grown in
numbers, had gained experience, and had acquired
such strength at last that victory was
certain, and that peace was concluded before
they had been really defeated. Our army was
never fully tested; it had been able to concentrate
but slowly, and, consequently, suffered in
detail from the blows of a more ready enemy.
When, after enormous sacrifices, it was eventually
able to mass in strength, and was furnished
with everything requisite for a determined campaign,
peace was concluded.</p>

<p>It cannot be truly said that the Japanese land
forces had defeated ours. At Liao-yang, on
the Sha Ho, and at Mukden, a comparatively
small portion of our army was opposed to
the whole armed might of Japan. Even in
August and September, 1905, when almost all
our reinforcements had been collected in the
Manchurian theatre of operations, we had only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
put about one-third of all our armed forces in
the field. Our navy was almost entirely destroyed
at Port Arthur and in the battle of
Tsushima, but our army in the Far East was
not only not destroyed, but had been gradually
strengthened by the reinforcements received,
and, after the battle of Mukden, by the expansion
of the three-battalion East Siberian
Rifle Regiments to four-battalion regiments, and
the formation of the 10th East Siberian Rifle
Division. These measures alone added seventy-six
battalions of infantry to its strength. We
must, therefore, look further afield than to our
numerical strength for the causes of our disasters.
Why was it that right up to March, 1905, our
troops were unable to win a battle? It is difficult
to reply to this, because we do not yet
know the strength of the enemy in the principal
battles. We know approximately the numbers
of battalions of the peace army which were in
the field, but not the number of reserve battalions
at the front, and, consequently, the actual
number of rifles. In war the issue is not decided
by the number of men present, but by the number
of rifles actually brought into the firing-line.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that when a trustworthy
history of the war compiled from Japanese
sources is published, our self-esteem will receive
a severe blow. We already know that in many
instances we were in superior strength to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
enemy, and yet were unable to defeat them.
The explanation of this phenomenon is simple.
Though they were weaker materially than we
were, the Japanese were morally stronger, and
the teaching of all history shows that it is the
moral factor which really counts in the long-run.
There are exceptions, of course, as when the side
whose <i>moral</i> is the weaker can place an absolutely
overwhelming force in the field, and so
wear out its opponents. This was the case of
the Federals as compared with the Confederates
in America, and of the British against the Boers.
It is indeed a lucky army which, starting a campaign
with the weakest <i>moral</i>, is able to improve
in both spirit and numbers at the same time.</p>

<p>This was the case with us. Between the
battle of Mukden and the end of the war our
army almost doubled in numbers, had taken up
a strong position, and was quite ready to advance.
The strength of the Japanese, on the
other hand, was exhausted (they were reduced
to filling up their ranks with their 1906 recruits),
and many things pointed to a weakening of their
spirit. As Japan was pre-eminently a naval
Power, our principal operations should have been
on the sea; and had we destroyed the enemyâs
fleet, there would have been no fighting on
Chinese territory. As I have already pointed
out, our fleet scarcely assisted the army at all;
for while taking shelter in Port Arthur, it did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
not attempt to prevent the enemyâs disembarkation.
Three Japanese armiesâthose of Oku,
Nodzu, and Nogiâlanded unhindered on the
Liao-tung Peninsula; the forces of Oku and
Nogi actually landed close to where our squadron
was lying. Though we possessed an excellent
base at Vladivostok, our main fleet was collected
at Port Arthurâin a naval sense a very
inferior place, for it possessed no docks nor
workshops, and no protection for the inner basin.</p>

<p>As regards our naval strength, I am unable
to refer to official figures, for I write from the
country,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> but I quote from an article published
in the <i>Ruski Viestnik</i> in 1905 by M. Burun, as
much of what he says agrees with what I had
previously known. Our fleet began to increase
after the Chino-Japanese War, the naval estimates
reaching Â£11,200,000 in 1904. At the outbreak
of hostilities it consisted of 28 sea-going and
14 coast-defence battleships, 15 sea-going gunboats,
39 cruisers, 9 ocean-going destroyers, 133
smaller destroyers, and 132 auxiliary vessels of less
importance. Between 1881 and 1904 we had spent
Â£130,000,000 in the creation of this fleet. The
naval estimates of the two nations for the years
preceding the war were, in millions of pounds:</p>

<p>Our fleet was neither ready nor concentrated.
Four cruisers were at Vladivostok, one at
Chemulpo, and the greater part of the Port
Arthur Squadron lay in the inner roads. A few
days before the attack of February&nbsp;9 it moved
out into the outer roads to carry out steam trials,
but proper precautions were not observed, even
though diplomatic relations had already been
broken off.</p>

<p>As far back as 1901 our Headquarter Staff
had estimated that in the event of war our
Pacific Ocean Fleet would be weaker than
Japanâs, but within two years of that date
Admiral Alexeieff, the Viceroy, stated in the
scheme for the strategical distribution of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
troops in the Far East<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that the defeat of our
fleet was impossible under existing conditions.</p>

<p>In their night attack of February&nbsp;9 the
Japanese put several of our best ships out of
action; but, serious as the damage was, it could
have been speedily repaired had we possessed
proper facilities in Port Arthur. Though we
had expended many millions in constructing
docks and quays at Dalny, Port Arthur was
without a dock, and repairs could only be executed
slowly. Still, our Pacific Ocean Squadron
revived when Admiral Makharoff arrived, and
for a short time its chances of success were
much increased. After Makharoffâs death the
command passed to Admiral Witgeft, who, upon
receiving instructions to force his way through
to Vladivostok, put to sea and engaged Togoâs
squadron. Witgeft was killed, and the fleet
inflicted some damage on Togoâs squadron, and
returned to Port Arthur without the loss of a
single ship. The battle of August 10 was indecisive,
though our blue-jackets fought gallantly
the whole day against a numerically superior
enemy, and beat off numerous attacks by destroyers.
After returning to Port Arthur the
fleet finally assumed its passive rÃ´le, and was
gradually disarmedâas in the Siege of Sevastopolâin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
order to strengthen the land defence of the
fortress, where our sailors did most excellent
work. What it might have accomplished on
its own element can be gauged from the performances
of the gallant little cruiser squadron
under Admiral Essen, which made a daring sally
from Vladivostok to the coasts of Japan. Not
only did Essenâs success cause considerable consternation
in Japan, but it resulted in action of
practical value to the army, for one vessel sunk
by the squadron was conveying siege material
for use against Port Arthur. On October&nbsp;14,
1904, Admiral Rozhdestvenskiâs fleet, consisting
of 7 battleships, 5 first-class cruisers, 3 second-class
cruisers, and 12 destroyers, with a complement
of 519 officers and 7,900 men, left Libau
for the Pacific Ocean, and Admiral Nebogatoffâs
squadron left to join it on February&nbsp;16, 1905.
The latter consisted of 1 sea-going battleship,
3 coast-defence battleships, and 1 first-class
cruiser, with a complement of 120 officers and
more than 2,100 men. Rozhdestvenskiâs squadron
had to steam 16,400 miles to reach Vladivostok.
In spite of the lack of coaling stations <i>en route</i>,
and in the face of extraordinary difficulties, it
eventually succeeded in reaching the Sea of
Japan, where it was utterly destroyed on May&nbsp;27
and 28, 1905, off Tsushima. In twenty-four
hours we lost 30 pennants sunk or captured out
of 47, and 137,000 from a total tonnage of 157,000.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
The light cruiser <i>Almaz</i> and 2 destroyersâthe
<i>Grozni</i> and <i>Bravi</i>âalone reached Vladivostok.
According to Admiral Togoâs reports, he lost
only 3 destroyers, while his casualties amounted
to 7 officers and 108 men killed, 40 officers and
620 men wounded. Many gallant exploits were
performed by our sailors in the fight: the battleship
<i>Suvaroff</i> continued firing until she sank,
and of the <i>Navarinâs</i> complement only two men
were saved; while the small ironclad <i>Ushakoff</i>
replied to the Japanese summons to surrender
with a broadside, and foundered with the whole
of her crew. M. Burun closes his remarkable
article in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âUndoubtedly many tactical mistakes were
among the contributory causes of the Tsushima
catastrophe: our initial error in allowing transports
to be with the fleet, the unseaworthiness and
the conspicuous colour of our ships, and many such
details; but the real cause was the unreadiness
of our fleet for war, and the criminal short-sightedness
of our Administration. Such a contingency
as war was never contemplated, and the
fleet was kept up entirely for show.</p>

<p>âOur crews were of the best material in the
world; they were brave and capable of learning,
but besides being unversed in the use of modern
implements of war (such as automatic gun-sights,
etc.), they were not accustomed to life at sea.
Our officers were possessed of a strong sense of
duty, and thoroughly appreciated the immense
importance of the task before them; but they
were new to the crews and to the ships, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
they had suddenly to command against a fleet
trained in the stern school of war. Born sailors,
the Japanese seamen never left their ships, while
our vessels had neither permanent nor full crews.
Even in the last eight months of the cruise of
our fleet our captains were unable, owing to the
shortage of ammunition, to put their crews
through a course of gunnery, or to test their
training. The ships only carried enough ammunition
for one battle. Yes, we lost our fleet
because the most important elementâthe <i>personnel</i>âwas
unprepared. We lost the war, and
lost our predominance on the Pacific Ocean,
because, even while preparing to celebrate the
anniversary of the gallant defence of Sevastopol,
we quite forgot that the strength of a navy is
only created by the spirit of every individual
member belonging to it.</p>

<p>âBut can it be that there is no one left of all
those gallant sailors who so proudly sailed under
the Cross of St. Andrew who possesses the secret of
training men? If so, then our Navy Department
will never succeed in creating a fleet. However
many the milliards spent, it will only succeed in
constructing a collection of ships such as now
rest at the bottom of the Sea of Japan. Mere
ships do not make a fleet, nor do they form the
strong right arm of an empire, for the strength
of a nation does not lie in armour, guns, or
torpedoes, but in the souls of the men behind
these things.â</p></div>

<p>Far from assisting our army, Rozhdestvenski
brought it irreparable harm. It was the defeat
of his squadron at Tsushima that brought about
negotiations and peace at a time when our army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
was ready to advanceâa million strong. As at
Sevastopol in 1855, the only assistance given by
our fleet to Port Arthur, except at Chin-chou,
was to land blue-jackets and guns.</p>

<p>Next to the absence of a Russian fleet, the
most important factor to assist the Japanese in
their offensive strategy and to impede us was
the condition of the Siberian and Eastern Chinese
Railways. If these lines had been more efficient,
we could have brought up our troops more
rapidly, and, as things turned out, 150,000 men
concentrated at first would have been of far
more value to us than the 300,000 who were
gradually assembled during nine months, only to
be sacrificed in detail. In my report upon the
War Ministry in 1900 (before Japan had completed
her armaments), I wrote that she could
mobilize 380,000 men and 1,090 guns, about
half of which could be transported across the
sea; that there were immediately ready only seven
divisions, with a war strength of 126,000 rifles,
5,000 sabres, and 494 guns. In March, 1903,
before visiting Japan, I calculated that if the
views then held by our naval authorities as to
the comparative strength of the two fleets were
correct, we ought to be ready, in the event of
war, to throw an army of 300,000 into Manchuria.
In the battles of Liao-yang and the Sha Ho we
only had from 150,000 to 180,000. If we had
had a better railway, and had been able to mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
at Liao-yang the number specified, we should
undoubtedly have won the day, in spite of our
mistakes.</p>

<p>As regards the railway problem, we counted,
in August, 1901, on having for military transport
purposes on the Eastern Chinese Railway
20 waggons running in the twenty-four hours,
while in the summer of 1903 we calculated
we should have 75. We were promised from
January&nbsp;1, 1904, five pairs<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> of military trains of
35 waggons each, or 175 waggons each way;
and it was supposed at the same time that the
Siberian Railway would be in a condition to run
seven pairs of military trains in the twenty-four
hours, but these hopes were not realized. Let
us see what actually did happen.</p>

<p>In 1903 we were only able to reckon on four
through military trains on the Siberian line, and
on three short trains on the Eastern Chinese.
Towards the end of that year relations with
Japan became strained; it seemed as if, having
made all her preparations, she was seeking a
pretext for war, and was therefore meeting all
the concessions we made by fresh and quite
impossible demands. Our unreadiness was only
too plain, but it seemed at that time that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
should be able, with two or three yearsâ steady
work, so to strengthen our position in the Far
East and improve the railway, the fleet, the
land forces, and the fortresses of Port Arthur
and Vladivostok, that Japan would have small
chance of success against us. It was proposed,
in the event of trouble, to send out, to begin
with [in addition to the troops already in the
Far East], reinforcements consisting of four army
corps (two regular and two reserve) from European
Russia. Owing to the unreadiness of the
railways, and the uncertainty as to the time it
would take to improve them, it was impossible
to draw up concentration time-tables with any
accuracy. According to these tables, 500 troop
trains and a large number of goods trains would
be necessary to transport from European Russia
the drafts for the Far East, the 3rd&nbsp;Battalions
of the East Siberian Rifle Regiments, several
batteries, local units and ammunition parks for
the East Siberian Rifle Divisions, the 4th&nbsp;Siberian
Corps, and the two army corps from Russia
(10th and 17th). Moreover, upon mobilization,
the Siberian Military District would require
local transport for a very considerable distance.
This would add about three weeks to the time
required for through transport of the above
reinforcements.</p>

<p>As I have said, we expected that from
January, 1904, the Siberian and Eastern Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
lines would be able to give us daily five trains
each way; but the concentration of one-half of
the reinforcements to go to the Far East actually
took five months from the declaration of war.
One of the most important of the War Ministerâs
tasks, therefore, was to get the Siberian and
Eastern Chinese lines into a more efficient state
as rapidly as possible. My scheme was to improve
them at first up to a capacity of seven trains
each way in the twenty-four hours, and on the
southern branch of the Eastern Chinese (along
which movements would have to take place
through Harbin from both sides, from Pri-Amur
and Trans-Baikal) to fourteen pairs of trains. My
proposal was approved by the Tsar, who noted
against the figure fourteen the words, âOr even
up to twelve pairs of military trains.â In the
middle of January, 1904, he appointed a special
committee to consider the questions of the money
and time required for the immediate improvement
of the railways as suggested. This committee,
consisting of the Ministers of War,
Ways and Communications, Finance, and the
State Comptroller, was under the presidency of
General Petroff, of the Engineers. It was instructed
to ascertain what should be done to
enable seven pairs of military trains to be run
on the Siberian and Eastern Chinese lines, and
twelve pairs on the southern branch (from
Harbin to Port Arthur).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>On January&nbsp;29, 1904, the Viceroy wrote of the state of the
Eastern Chinese Railway as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âAccording to my information, there is reason
to doubt the official figures as to the carrying
capacity and the ability to cope with increased
traffic of the Eastern Chinese Railway. Rolling-stock
is deficient, and many engines are out of
order. The water-supply is so uncertain that
the officials have recently been forced to refuse
to accept goods for transport. The soldiers are
the only reliable portion of the subordinate
railway staff, and on this account some alarm is
already felt by the higher officials. But the most
serious want is that of a sufficient fuel reserve.
The bulk of the coal is stocked at Dalny, whence
1,000 tons have to be distributed over the line
daily, of which amount only half goes to increasing
the reserve, the other half being required
for current consumption. To transport the
whole of the reserve by rail from Dalny would
take about twenty-five days, but the railway
would even then be able to cope with the increased
traffic for a period of three months only.
In war we can scarcely count on the large railway
demands being met, as the coal is sea-borne.â</p></div>

<p>An official statement, prepared to show the
then position of the railway, was laid before the
special committee at a sitting held four days
before the commencement of hostilities. According
to the Minister of Ways and Communications
(Prince Khilkoff), the Siberian line could only
run six pairs of through trains, of which four
were military, one was passenger, and one service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
(for the railway); owing to the scarcity of rolling-stock,
only three of the four military trains could
carry troops, the fourth being given up to goods
(trucks). But the War Department representative
in charge of Transport, who was at the
meeting, pointed out that on the portion of the
Trans-Baikal line, between Karim and Manchuria
station, only three trains altogether, whether of
troops or goods, could be run. The official
information furnished by the Ministry of Ways
and Communications thus differed from that of
the military railway representative. The representative
of the Eastern Chinese Railway stated
that it would soon be possible to run a total of
five pairs of trains on that line, while he calculated
on working up by April to a running
capacity of six pairs along the main line and
seven pairs on the southern branch. On going
into details as to the work that would be necessary
before this could be done, it was discovered
that, owing to the very inferior equipment of the
different branches of the Siberian and Eastern
Chinese lines, the necessary additions to rolling-stock
and the construction of sidings, crossings,
and water-supply would absorb a very large sum.
The workshops on the Eastern Chinese line were
poorly equipped, and there were not nearly enough
engine depÃ´ts, while the large amount of rails,
fish-plates, sleepers and ballast necessary would
have to be conveyed while the transport of troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was going on. On March&nbsp;9 I wrote to General
Sakharoff, then in charge of the War Department,
and pointed out that, owing to what I
had heard as to the deficiency of engine depÃ´ts
in the Viceroyalty, and in order to facilitate concentration,
I considered it essential that, up to
Manchuria station, not more than one train a day
should be taken up for goods, the remainder
being reserved for troops.</p>

<p>Lake Baikal was the great obstacle on the
Siberian Railway. The ice-breaker did not work
regularly, and progress on the construction of
the Circum-Baikal line was slow. Prince Khilkoff
conceived and carried out the idea of laying
a temporary line across the ice of the lake,
and so passing the waggons over. He also proposed
to dismantle the locomotives, take the
parts across by horse traction, and reassemble
them on the eastern side. On February&nbsp;16 I
received the following letter from him:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="baikal">
<img alt="" width="700px" height="auto"
       src="images/baikal.jpg" />
<div class="caption">RUSSIAN TRANSPORT CARS BEING DRAGGED ACROSS<br />
  LAKE BAIKAL ON THE ICE BY HORSES.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âI have returned from inspecting the Trans-Baikal
line. The line will be able immediately
to run six pairs of trains of all kinds. I have
started work building sidings for nine pairs, but
this number will not run until the warm weather
sets in and we get rolling-stock. Almost all the
rivers now are frozen solid. Thirteen temporary
water-supplies are now under construction. I
will write again about the warm weather and
the increase up to twelve pairs of trains. Khorvat,
whom I saw in Manchuria, tells me that the
following numbers of military trains can be run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
on that line<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>: three pairs on the western portion,
five on the southern. The further traffic acceleration
depends almost exclusively on the receipt of
rolling-stock. Heavy snowstorms have somewhat
delayed the laying of the line across Lake
Baikal; but I have hopes of success. Arrangements
are being made at Manchuria station for
the temporary accommodation of 4,000 to 6,000
men in hut barracks.â</p></div>

<p>It is clear from this letter that when we entered
upon hostilities we had for mobilization, concentration,
and the carriage of supplies only
three military trains in the twenty-four hours, for
the carrying power of the western branch of the
Eastern Chinese line from Manchuria station to
Harbin fixed the capacity of the line throughout
its whole length from Europe to Harbin. Thus,
in the first period of the war, Lake Baikal was
not the only obstacle to rapid transit. The
freezing of the rivers in Trans-Baikalia was also
a serious difficulty, and necessitated the improvisation
of water-supply at numerous stations.
But what was most wanted was an early delivery
of rolling-stock for the Trans-Baikal and Eastern
Chinese lines, where the running capacity was
considerable, but the carrying capacity was
limitedâowing to the shortage of rolling-stockâto
three military trains in the twenty-four hours.
Under normal conditions we should have been
compelled to wait for the opening of Lake Baikal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
in the spring before commencing the transport
of rolling-stock eastwards from it, which would
have meant that we should have had to be content
with three pairs of trains till the middle of
March. The ability and immense energy of
Prince Khilkoff, however, rescued us from this
serious plight. Though in very bad health, he
took the matter in hand personally, regardless of
the climate and all other difficulties. On March&nbsp;6
I received the following message from him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âOn the 17th [February] we began to send
rolling-stock across the ice [Lake Baikal]. More
than 150 waggons have been sent across, and
about 100 are now on their way over. If the
weather is favourable, I shall start sending
engines over.â</p></div>

<p>On March&nbsp;9 I received another message,
recounting the difficulties that were caused by
the frequent great changes of temperature, for
the ice on the lake cracked badly, and it was
often necessary to relay the line just put down.
He asked me to help him with fatigue-parties
from the army, which I gave him.</p>

<p>What had to be done in order to improve, to
some extent, the Manchurian line, is recorded in
the report of the special committee submitted to
me on March&nbsp;9, 1904. The officials of the
Eastern Chinese Railway calculated that to
increase the carrying capacity of its main line
up to seven, and of the southern branch to twelve,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
pairs of military trains, would entail an expenditure
of Â£4,424,000. With this sum the following
improvements in actual traffic might be made:
On the main line, up to 7 pairs of troop trains,
1 pair of passenger, 1 pair service; total, 9 pairs;
running capacity, 10 pairs; water-supply for 10
pairs. On the southern line, up to 12 pairs
troop trains, 1 passenger train, and 2 service;
total, 15; running capacity, 16; water-supply for
16. Among the chief items were the laying of
eighty odd miles of sidings, which necessitated
the delivery and distribution along the line
of between 9,000 and 10,000 tons of rails,
sleepers, and fish-plates, and the construction of
224 engine-sheds, 373,400 square feet of workshops,
and 265,600 square feet of platforms.
For the construction of dwelling-houses Â£400,000
was necessary. The water-supply of the southern
branch was to be increased by 60 per cent., and
rolling-stock, of the value of Â£2,300,000, including
335 engines, 2,350 covered waggons, 810 trucks,
and 113 passenger coaches, were to be supplied.
This increase in traffic to seven pairs of military
trains on the Siberian and Eastern Chinese lines
and twelve on the southern branch was, of course,
only a first instalment of what was required.
Orders were issued in June, 1904, when I was
in Manchuria, for the respective lines to be
brought up to the above capacity.</p>

<p>Before my departure to take over command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of the army in the Far East, I submitted a statement
to the Tsar on March&nbsp;7, showing what was
most urgently required to enable us to fight Japan
successfully. This was endorsed by the Tsar
himself, and sent to the War Minister, General
Sakharoff. The following is an extract from it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âI have the honour to report that the following
are the measures which, in my opinion, are
most urgently required:</p>

<p>â1. Improvement of the Siberian and Eastern
Chinese lines so as gradually to work up to
fourteen pairs of military trains in the twenty-four
hours over the whole length, and eighteen
pairs on the southern branch. Every additional
pair of trains will not only shorten the time for
concentration, but will at the same time help the
supply services. Great difficulties will be encountered
in carrying out what I recommend,
especially in increasing the running capacity on
the Central Siberian and Trans-Baikal lines.
Once these difficulties are overcome, the necessary
increase of traffic can easily be attained by means
of a loan of rolling-stock from other lines. I
venture to assert that of all urgently pressing
questions, that of improving the railway communication
between Russia and Siberia is the
most important. It must therefore be taken up
at once in spite of the enormous cost. The
money expended will not be wasted; it will, on
the contrary, be in the highest sense productive,
inasmuch as it will shorten the duration of
the war.</p>

<p>â2. &hellip; Together with the carriage of troops
and goods by rail, a transport service must be
organized on the old Siberian road and on that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
alongside the Eastern Chinese Railway. For a
successful concentration and the rapid transit of
supplies, we ought to have thirty troop trains in
the twenty-four hours. Even when the measures
I suggest are carried out, we shall only have a
total of fourteen pairsâless than half of what
are really required. Our present precarious
position, therefore, can be realized, as the total
number of military trains we are able to count
upon between Baikal and Harbin is four pairs!â</p></div>

<p>When I travelled over the Siberian and Manchurian
lines in March, 1904, I was accompanied
by M. Pavlovski, who was in charge of the Siberian
line. He told me that if he were given rolling-stock
on loan, he would be able that year to increase
the number of military trains to ten, and
later on to fourteen, pairs, at a cost of Â£650,000.
On receiving his report, I sent on March&nbsp;19 the
following message to General Sakharoff:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âWith this I am telegraphing to Secret Councillor
Miasiedoff Ivanoff as follows:</p>

<p>â&thinsp;âI earnestly request you to arrange for the
early improvement of the running and carrying
capacity of the Siberian Railway. Engineer
Pavlovski, in charge of the Siberian line, informs
me that he has already represented that, in order
to work up the number of trains on the western
portion to thirteen, in the central to fourteen, and
in the hilly portion fifteen (of which nine, ten, and
eleven will be military) during the summer, an
expenditure of Â£650,000 is absolutely necessary.
Please arrange as soon as possible to credit him
with this amount and an equal sum for the
Trans-Baikal line. I have informed the Tsar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
as to my opinion of the necessity of eventually
working up the whole line from the Volga to
Harbin to fourteen trains, though it be only
twelve at first. Pavlovski considers it desirable
and possible to get seventeen pairs of through
trains. I cannot hope to act energetically unless
the railway to Harbin is improved to the extent
I recommend. From Harbin onwards it is absolutely
necessary eventually to have eighteen,
and temporarily fourteen, pairs of trains. I
earnestly beg you to support this request.â&thinsp;â</p></div>

<p>By the middle of March Prince Khilkoff succeeded
in sending across the ice-line on Lake
Baikal sixty-five dismantled locomotives and
1,600 waggons. [When I met him he was very
ill, but had succeeded in accomplishing a tremendous
work, which it is to be hoped the
country will appreciate.] Ãchelons<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of troops
marched twenty-nine miles over the ice in the
day, every four men having a small sledge to
carry their kit, etc. When I passed across the
lake not more than four Ã©chelons were crossing
in the twenty-four hours. The Trans-Baikal
line was working very badly, and together with
the lake was a great cause of delay.</p>

<p>In order to expedite the troop moves in
Southern Manchuria, I telegraphed to the Viceroy
on March&nbsp;16, emphasizing the necessity of improvising
road transport on the many roads between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Harbin and Mukden for the carriage of units
and supplies from the former place, and of not
taking up more than one train in the day on the
southern branch for goods. At the same time I
drew attention to the fact that the troops should
not be allowed to take with them more than
their field-service scale of baggage. I had noticed
that the 3rd&nbsp;Battalion of the East Siberian
Rifles, which I had inspected on the way to the
front, were taking as much baggage as if moving
in the course of ordinary relief. On March&nbsp;27 I
reached Liao-yang, where the weary wait for the
arrival of reinforcements began. The first troops
to arrive were the 3rd&nbsp;Battalions for the seven
East Siberian Rifle Brigades, at first one and
then two in the day. These were followed by the
artillery units and drafts for the brigades of the
31st and 35th&nbsp;Divisions. Meanwhile the money
required for the improvement of the Siberian
and Eastern Chinese lines had not been allotted
as quickly as it should have been. On May&nbsp;19
I received from the Ministry of Finance a telegram
forwarding a copy of another to the Viceroy,
dated 15th. From this it appeared that the
question of bringing the carrying capacity of the
Eastern Chinese Railway up to seven pairs of
trains, and that of the southern branch to twelve
pairs, had been thoroughly gone into at numerous
meetings of the special committee, and that the
necessity for despatching the following to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
line was recognized: 190 miles of rails with
joints, 770 sets of crossings, 355 engines, 88 passenger
coaches, 2,755 goods vans and trucks.
In addition to these, Admiral Alexeieff asked for
30 miles of rails, 265 sets of crossings, and 1,628
vans. The Finance Minister stated that it would
be necessary, in order to improve and develop
the line, to provide it with 3,000 truck-loads of
various stores. But as it had only been found
possible to send 200 trucks in April and 201 in
May, or a total of 401, he was of opinion that
âthe whole amount could not possibly be
guaranteed earlier than the autumn.â The extent
to which the despatch of these was delayed
is evident from the fact that out of 1,000 vans,
only 60 had been sent off by May&nbsp;18, and out of
355 engines, only 105. By July&nbsp;30, 120 more
engines had been sent, but it was not proposed
to forward the remaining 130 till a good deal
later.</p>

<p>Owing to three regiments of the 1st&nbsp;Siberian
Division being detained in Harbin during the
whole of April, the Manchurian army was not
augmented by a single battalion. Meanwhile
we had been defeated on May 1&nbsp;at the Ya-lu,
and on the 6th Okuâs army had begun to disembark
at Pi-tzu-wo.</p>

<p>Though the 2nd&nbsp;Siberian Division reached
Liao-yang in the second half of May, we were
still very weak. On May&nbsp;23 General Jilinski
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
brought me a letter from the Viceroy, in which
Admiral Alexeieff wrote that the time had come
for the Manchurian army to advance towards
the Ya-lu or Port Arthur. In spite of my
opinion as to our unreadiness for any forward
movement, in spite of the fact that out of twelve
divisions of reinforcements only one had arrived,
in spite of the inefficiency of the railway, an
advance with insufficient numbers was ordered
and carried out. The result was the disaster on
June&nbsp;14 at Te-li-ssu. The leading units of
the 10th&nbsp;Corps did not reach Liao-yang till
June&nbsp;17; thus it took more than three months
from the beginning of hostilities for our troops
in the Far East to receive reinforcements from
European Russia. During this prolonged and
particularly important period the burden and
heat of the campaign was borne by five East
Siberian Rifle Divisions, whose two-battalion
regiments had been expanded into three-battalion
regiments as late as March and April; the
4th&nbsp;Siberian Corps, which arrived in May, did not
take part in any fighting. Taking advantage of
our inferiority in numbers, and especially the
inaction of our fleet during these three months,
the enemy disembarked their three armies on the
Liao-tung Peninsula and in Kuan-tung. The
1st&nbsp;Army, under Kuroki, moved from Korea into
Southern Manchuria, and Japan won three
battles on landâat the Ya-lu, Chin-chou, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Te-li-ssu. Had the railway only been ready
at the beginning of hostilities, even to run only
six through military trains, we should have had
three army corps at Te-li-ssuânamely, the
1st and 4th&nbsp;Siberians and the 10th&nbsp;Army Corps,
instead of only the 1st Siberian Corps. The
issue of this battle would have been different,
and this would undoubtedly have affected the
whole course of the campaign, for we should
have secured the initiative.</p>

<p>The arrival of the first units of the 10th&nbsp;Army
Corps was more than opportune, but events did
not permit us to await the concentration of the
whole of it. Kurokiâs army was advancing, and
the line Sai-ma-chi, An-ping, Liao-yang, on which
he was moving in force, was only covered by our
cavalry and one regiment of infantry. Consequently,
as soon as the leading brigade of the
9th&nbsp;Division arrived at Liao-yang, it was sent
off in that direction. Similarly, troops of the
17th&nbsp;Army and 5th&nbsp;Siberian Corps went straight
into action from the train without waiting the
concentration of their corps. It was only on
September&nbsp;2â<i>i.e.</i>, after seven monthsâthat the
three army corps (10th, 17th, and 5th&nbsp;Siberian),
sent from Europe to reinforce the field army,
were all concentrated in the Manchurian theatre.
During the decisive fighting at Liao-yang, the
85th&nbsp;Regiment was the only unit of the 1st&nbsp;Army
Corps which had arrived, and it went straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
from the train into the battle. If, at the beginning
of the war, we had had only one more military
train a day, we would have had present at the
battle of Liao-yang the 1st&nbsp;Army Corps and
6th&nbsp;Siberian Corps, and with these sixty extra
battalions must certainly have defeated the
enemy. But the railway fatally affected us in
other ways, for while we were feeding our army
with fresh units as reinforcements, we were unable
at the same time to find carriage for the drafts
for the advanced troops, which had suffered heavy
losses in killed, wounded, and sick. For example,
in the fighting of five long months, from
May&nbsp;14 to October&nbsp;14, the Manchurian army
lost in killed, wounded, and sick, over 100,000
men, to replace which, during that period, it
only received 21,000. The enemy, on the other
hand, were making good their casualties quickly
and uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>By the beginning of October the 1st&nbsp;Army
Corps and the 6th&nbsp;Siberian Corps had arrived.
Taking advantage of these reinforcements, I
ordered an advance. In the bloody battle on
the Sha&nbsp;Ho, where we lost about 45,000 men,
killed and wounded, neither side could claim a
decisive victory. During the four months immediately
preceding the February (1905) battles
the army received drafts to replace wastage, and
was reinforced by the 8th and 16th&nbsp;Corps,
besides five brigades of Rifles, but in that month
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
it was still short of its establishment by 50,000
menâ<i>i.e.</i>, two whole army corps. In other
words, as regards numbers, the 8th and
16th&nbsp;Corps might be said merely to have made up
the wastage in the others. It is true these corps
brought us additional artillery; but looking at it
purely from the point of view of their fighting
value, I should have preferred to have received
them in the shape of drafts; I could then have
incorporated them in the battle-tried corps, instead
of having them as separate inexperienced
units. Even with these considerable reinforcements
our position in February, 1905, was worse
than before, for the fall of Port Arthur enabled
the Japanese to be augmented by Nogiâs army.
Immediately after the 16th&nbsp;Corps the field army
was to have received two Rifle brigades, one
Cossack infantry brigade, and the 4th&nbsp;Army
Corps; but their despatch was delayed for more
than a month, in order to allow a quantity of
stores which had collected on the line to be railed
up. It was only on March&nbsp;5â<i>i.e.</i>, five weeks
after the arrival of the last units of the
16th&nbsp;Army Corpsâthat the leading battalions of the
3rd&nbsp;Rifle Brigade (the 9th and 10th&nbsp;Regiments)
reached Mukden, and they at once went into
action. But for this break we should have had
at the battle of Mukden a main reserve of more
than sixty battalions, which, even allowing for
our mistakes, might have turned the balance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
our favour. In a full year, from the beginning
of March, 1904, till the beginning of March,
1905, we railed up eight army corps, three Rifle
brigades, and one reserve division to the front.
Thus each corps on the average required, roughly,
one and a half months to perform the journey.
These figures indicate the peculiar disabilities
under which we laboured in massing superior
numbers. Owing to our far too slow concentration,
our forces were bound to be destroyed in
detail, as we were obliged to accept battle.
With the transit of troops, the materials necessary
for the work of improving the railways had
to be railed up, and from August onwards the
progress made in this work was remarkable. In
October, 1904, I received a message from General
Sakharoff to the effect that, according to the
Minister of Ways and Communications, the Siberian
main line would have a carrying capacity,
after October&nbsp;28, of twelve pairs of military
trains. But this promise was not carried out for
almost a year, though the traffic in October and
November was heavy. Altogether, in one and
a half months (forty-seven days), from October&nbsp;28
to December 14, there arrived in Harbin 257
military, 147 goods (commissariat, artillery, red
cross, and railway service), and 23 hospital trains
(total, 427), which gives an average of nine pairs
in the twenty-four hours, of which only five and
a half carried troops. In ten months of war the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
railway had increased its traffic from three military
trains to nine, so it took on an average more
than one and a half months to add one pair of
trains to the traffic. Finally, in the summer of
1905, after sixteen months of war, the railways
worked, I believe, up to a rate of twelve pairs of
military trains on the main line and eighteen on
the southern branchâ<i>i.e.</i>, on the main line we
did not even then get so high as the number
(fourteen pairs) which I had asked for on March&nbsp;7,
1904, when leaving for the front.</p>

<p>From all I have said it must be amply clear
what a decisive factor the railway was. Every
extra daily train would have enabled us to have
at our disposal one or two corps more in the
decisive battles. Thus a very great responsibilityâthat
of not losing a single day in improving
the linesâlay with the Ministries of
Ways and Communications, of Finance, and,
to a certain extent, with the Ministry of War.
Looking back to what was done by these departments,
it must be confessed that the results
attained were very great, and that the railway
employÃ©s did magnificent service. By the end
of the war we had within the limits of the Viceroyalty
an army of 1,000,000 men, well supplied
with everything necessary for existence and for
fighting. As this army was conveyed while
work was being simultaneously carried out on
the railway-line, the result, though largely attained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
by forced labour, was, for a badly laid single line
of railway, somewhat striking. By means of good
lines of railway, mobilization and concentration
are very quickly effected nowadays. Germany and
Austria can throw about 2,000,000 soldiers on to
our frontiers in from ten to fourteen days, and
their rapid concentration will enable them to
seize the initiative. Our forces reached the
front, so to speak, by driblets, which resulted in
paralysis of all initiative on our part.</p>

<p>Thinking that the information with regard to
the railways, sent by the War Minister in
October, 1904 [which reached me on November&nbsp;8],
meant the realization of my recommendations of
February, 1904, I considered it time to submit
to the Tsar my views as to the necessity for
further work, for I considered it most necessary
that the line should be at once doubled over
its whole length. I expressed my opinion on
this question in a letter to the Tsar, dated
November&nbsp;12, 1904. As there is nothing in this
letter that can be regarded as secret, I will quote
it literally:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âY<span class="small">OUR</span>
           M<span class="small">AJESTY</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">âBefore leaving to join the army, I was
permitted to give my opinion as to our principal
requirements to insure success in the war. My
opinion was submitted in a memorandum dated
7th&nbsp;March, and was marginally annotated by
Your Majesty. Eight months ago I expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in this memorandum the opinion that, for a successful
concentration and rapid transport of all
the supplies necessary to an army in the field,
the running of 30 pairs of military trains in the
24 hours was essential. As a first step I considered
the improvement of the Siberian and
Eastern Chinese lines should be taken in hand,
so as to bring up the number of trains to 14 pairs
in the 24 hours along the main line, and 18 pairs
along the southern branch. Against the words
âup to 14 pairs in 24 hoursâ Your Majesty was
pleased to note, âVery necessary.â In a message
reaching me on the 8th&nbsp;November the
War Minister has informed me that from the
28th&nbsp;October the Siberian and Trans-Baikal lines
will have a carrying capacity of 12 pairs of trains
in the day, and that it is proposed further to
work up the Siberian main line to 14 pairs,
and that the Minister of Finance<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> has been
approached with regard to the urgency for improving
the Eastern Chinese lines so as to
correspond with the Siberian. Thus, we have
not, in eight months, reached the number indicated
as necessary in my former memorandum.
I now earnestly request that as a first step the
whole Siberian main line and the Eastern
Chinese line as far as Harbin should be worked
up to a carrying capacity of 14 pairs, and on the
southern branch to 18 pairs. I know that this
is no easy matter, but it is absolutely essential,
and admits of no delay. These 14 pairs will
by no means supply all our requirements. The
larger number of men in the field has increased
the demand for transport. It is calculated that,
to supply the army with everything necessary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and to carry back what is not required, not
30 pairs of trains, but 48, are essential. This is
not exaggerated; it is the minimum under normal
conditions. Each Manchurian army should have
its own line (like the Bologoe-Siedlce)<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> giving
48 pairs of trains in 24 hours. We must bow,
of course, to the impossible, but we shall have to
pay in human life and in money for a prolonged
war. The urgency of every extra train can
easily be seen. If we had had one more pair of
trains available at the beginning of the war,
we should have had 2 extra army corpsâthe
1st and 6th&nbsp;Siberian Corpsâin the August
fights at Liao-yang, and our success would practically
have been assured. This one extra train
could have brought in drafts during September
and October an extra 50,000 men, of which we
are now in such urgent need.</p>

<p>âIn the future, every month will increase the
necessity of strengthening the line still more.
When the field army was small, we drew our
supplies almost entirely from local sources (wheat,
barley, hay, straw, fuel, and cattle), but these
will soon be exhausted, and the provisioning
the army will depend on supplies from Europe.
When we move forward our position will become
worse, for we shall be moving into a part of
Manchuria already devastated by war, and into
a hilly tract which was never rich in supplies.
The daily transport of provisions (flour, groats,
oats, hay, and meat) for our present establishment
takes up 5 trains, and we soon shall have
to provide carriage for live-stock. But the army
cannot live from hand to mouth. A quantity
of supplies must be collected, sufficient to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
a reserve for the force for some months, besides
satisfying current requirements, and this must
be distributed in the advance and main depÃ´ts.
It will take 5 additional trains a day for one
month to collect one monthâs reserve. Only by
having a large number of trains can we organize
our advance depÃ´ts with necessary rapidity, and
move them to fresh points. The demand for
trains is greatest on those days when fighting is
in progress. A number of urgent demandsâamounting
sometimes to hundreds during two
or three daysâare made, not only for supplies,
but for the carriage of military and
engineer stores, troops, parks, and the transport
of drafts and of wounded. The needs of an army
in war are so varied and so vast that it is considered
necessary in Europe to have for each
army corps a special line of rails (single track),
capable of running 14 to 20 pairs of trains in the
24 hours. For our 9 army corps we have only
one single line of rails running (in the last few
weeks) from 8 to 10 pairs of trains. The inability
of the line to cope with the necessities of the war
is the main reason for the slow and indecisive
nature of the campaign. Our reinforcements
arrive in driblets. Supplies despatched from
Russia in the spring are still on the Siberian
line. Waterproofs sent for the summer will
arrive when we want fur coats; fur coats will be
received when waterproofs are wanted. But so
far, during all these months that we have been
in contact with the enemy, have fought and
have retired, we have not been hungry, because
we have been living on the country. The situation
is now altogether changed, for local resources
will last only for a short time longer. Our horses
will soon have to be fed on hay and straw, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
if we do not make extraordinary efforts to
improve the railway and concentrate a large
quantity of supplies at the advanced base, our
men, who are concentrated in great numbers
on small areas, will, after the horses, begin to
suffer hardship and hunger, and will fall sick.
Any accidental damage to the railway will be
sorely felt.</p>

<p>âI am expressing my firm conviction with
complete frankness as the officer in command of
three armies, that, for their successful operations,
we must at once start laying a second track
throughout the whole Siberian trunk line and on
the Eastern Chinese Railway. Our army must be
connected with Russia by a line capable of running
48 pairs of trains in the day.</p>

<p>âI have some experience of my profession,
and was for eight years in charge of the management
of the Trans-Caspian Railway, and I am
convinced that all these difficulties can be overcome
if Your Majesty is pleased to order it.
Possibly the war will be finished before we shall
have laid the second line of rails over more than
a fraction of the whole distance; on the other
hand, it may continue so long that only a double
track will save the situation. Only with a
double line also shall we be able at the end of
the war to send back rapidly all the troops which
came from Russia and to demobilize. We are
living in the midst of events of immense importance
on which depends the future, not only
of the Far East, but, to a certain extent, that of
Russia. We must not shirk sacrifices that will
insure victory and subsequent peace in the Far
East. Neither a conquered Japan nor a sleeping
China will permit such peace unless Russia possesses
the power to despatch army corps to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Far East more rapidly than she can at present.
A double line alone will enable this to be done.
While keeping this as our main ultimate object,
we should make every effort now to work the railways
up to a traffic capacity of 14 pairs of trains
as far as Harbin, and 18 beyond.</p>

<p>âHaving set to work to double the line, we
must try to arrange that one section will give us
18 pairs of military trains a day (perhaps it will
be best to begin from the hilly portions). As
the second line is laid, we shall be able to work
up to a running and carrying capacity along the
whole line to Harbin and southwards of at first
24 pairs of trains, then 36, and eventually 48.â</p></div>

<p>Upon receipt of this letter from me, the first
thing that the St. Petersburg authorities did
was to work out the details of the preliminary
arrangements for doubling the line. They tried
to formulate some scheme whereby the necessary
construction material could be carried on the
railway without cutting down the number of
troop trains. It was suggested that the rails
should be sent via the Arctic Ocean, and apparently
some attempt to do this was carried
out, but later all idea of doubling the line during
the war was abandoned. It was a pity, for the
earth-work might have been carried out without
interfering with the traffic. Had we carried out
this important measure, we should have made
our position in the Far East far stronger than it
is now.</p>

<p>While they were making ready for war with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
us, the Japanese concluded a treaty with Great
Britain, by which they were assured of the non-interference
of any other Power. We, on the
contrary, had not only made no preparations for
war in the east, but did not even consider it possible
to weaken to any great extent our frontiers on the
west, in the Caucasus, or in Central Asia. Our
diplomats neither steered clear of war with Japan,
nor insured against interference in the west.
The result was that, while Japan advanced
against us in her full strength, we could only
spare an inconsiderable portion of our army in
European Russia to reinforce the Far East.
We had to fight with one eye on the west.
The army corps stationed in Western Russia were
in a much higher state of preparation than those
in the interior as regards the number of men in
the ranks and the number of guns, horses, etc.,
and they were armed with quick-firing guns.
We, however, took corps that were on the lower
peace footing (the 17th and 1st), and gave them
artillery from the frontier corps; while the efficiency
of some of the units we took, which had
companies from 160 to 100 strong in peace-time,
varied a great deal. It was due to this quite
natural fear for our western frontier that of five
army corps sent to the Far East, three were
composed of reserve divisions. We had to keep
troops back for the maintenance of internal
order; Japan did not have to do this. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
picked troopsâthe Guards and Grenadiersâwere
not sent to the front; on the other hand,
the Japanese Guards Division was the first to
attack us at the Ya-lu. Thus, though we had
a standing army of 1,000,000 men, we sent
reserve units and army corps on the lower establishment
to the front, and entrusted the hardest
work in the field, not to our regular standing
army, but to men called up from the reserve.
In a national war, when the populace is fired
with patriotism, and everything is quiet in the
interior of the country, such a course might be
sound; but in the war with Japan, which was
not understood, and was disliked by the nation,
it was a great mistake to throw the principal
work on to the reserves. In the summer of
1905 we corrected this mistake, and filled up the
army with young soldiers, with recruits of 1905,
and drafts from the regular army. These young
soldiers arrived at the front cheerful and full of
hope, and in a very different frame of mind to
that of the reservists. It was a pleasure to see
the drafts of regulars proceeding by train to the
frontâthey were singing and full of spirit. The
majority of them were volunteers, and they would
undoubtedly have done magnificently if they had
had a chance, but more than 300,000 of them
saw no service owing to the hasty peace.</p>

<p>In her war with France in 1870, Prussia,
assured of our neutrality, had nothing to fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
from us, and was able to leave only an inconsiderable
number of men on our frontier and to
enter upon the struggle with all her strength.
Similarly, Japan was able to throw her full
strength into the struggle from the very commencement.
We, on the other hand, considered
it advisable to keep our main forces in readiness
in case of a European war, and only a small part
of the army stationed in European Russia was
sent to the Far East. Not a single army corps
was taken from the troops in the Warsaw
Military District, our strongest garrison. Even
my request to send the 3rd Guards Division to
the front from there was not granted, while our
numerous dragoon regiments were represented
by a single brigade. We kept our dragoons on
the western frontier, and sent to the war the
3rd Category regiments of the Trans-Baikal
and Siberian Cossacks, consisting of old men
mounted on small horses. They reminded one
more of infantry soldiers on horseback<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> than
of cavalry. In my report to the Tsar on
March 7, 1904, I requested that the reinforcements
from Russia might be mobilized simultaneously
and immediately after the Easter
holidays, and I gave the following reasons:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âBy this measure the units, especially the
reserve ones, will get time to settle down. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
will also be possible to put them through a
course of musketry and some military training,
and it will give time to organize the transport,
parks, and hospitals.â</p></div>

<p>I considered it important that units detailed
for the Far East should have as long as possible
to shake down, and to receive some training
before starting for the front.</p>

<p>The above memorandum, with the Tsarâs
remarks on it, was sent to the War Minister for
his guidance; but General Sakharoff either did
not carry out some of the important recommendations
I had emphasized most, or altered
them, and carried them out too late. As regards
the date of mobilizing the reinforcements,
he did not share my view (1) as to the necessity
for a simultaneous mobilization, and (2) as to
the necessity for mobilizing immediately after
Easter. In a memorandum drawn up by him,
dated March 18, 1904, he asked permission to
mobilize the reinforcements in three lots instead
of at once. Six Cossack regiments were first of
all detailed for mobilization in the end of
April, then the 10th&nbsp;Army Corps on May 1,
the 17th&nbsp;Army Corps on May 1 or a little
later, and four reserve divisions of the Kazan
Military District at the end of June. In a
second memorandum (July&nbsp;31) the question was
again raised whether all the reinforcements
should be mobilized simultaneously or at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
different times. The Headquarter Staff preferred
the latter alternative. Besides the poor carrying
capacity of the Siberian Railway, the reason
given was thatâ</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>â... The political horizon might become so
clouded as to make the simultaneous mobilization
of all the troops mentioned in the statement
inadvisable.â</p></div>

<p>Against this part of the memorandum I wrote
the words, âIt would be better to do it simultaneously.â
On my way to the front I received
a telegram from General Sakharoff, dated
March&nbsp;21, in which he said that my request
for the troops guarding the line to Harbin to
be supplied from one of the divisions of the
Kazan Military District, and for this division
to be mobilized together with the other reinforcing
troops directly after the Easter holidays,
could not be acceded to, owing to the inconvenience
to which the people of that district
would be put by so early a mobilization. He
suggested that guards for the railway might be
found from one of the divisions of the
4th&nbsp;Siberian Corpsâin other words, that this corps
should be broken up. The result of the reinforcements
being mobilized at different dates,
contrary to my wishes, was that when the leading
units reached the front, they had not settled down
properly; the men did not know their officers,
and <i>vice versÃ¢</i>. Few corps had been able to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
a musketry course, the 2nd&nbsp;Category reservists
did not know the rifle, and hardly any had
been tactically exercised, or if they had, it had
been only for a few days. Divisions and corps
had not been practised with the three arms.
The 6th&nbsp;Siberian Corps was mobilized under
fairly favourable circumstances, the 55th and
72nd&nbsp;Infantry Divisions being sent into camp
in 1904, but these divisions were trained without
artillery or cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In former days troops had to make long
marches in full field-service order before they
reached the battle-field. If properly conducted,
these marches hardened the men, and enabled
units to settle down; all superfluous baggage
was discarded, the weaker men were left behind,
and officers and men got to know one another.
But nowadays, with railway transport, the results
are very different. Going to the Far East, our
men were crowded up in railway carriages for as
long as forty days at a time, out of the control of
their officers, who were in different compartments.
In the old and well-disciplined units no particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
harm resulted, but in the case of newly
formed units, whose reservistsâparticularly
those of the 2nd Category, just summoned from
their homesâconsisting of peasants and town-bred
men, were all in carriages together, instead
of with regulars, it was most harmful. If to
this fact be added their original unwillingness
to go to the front, their lack of military spirit,
and the frame of mind induced by the seditious
proclamations with which they were lavishly
supplied, the small fighting value of these reinforcements
can be easily imagined. Many commanding
officers of such regiments told me that
not only did they not know the men under
them, but that, in spite of a journey of from
forty to fifty days, even the company commanders
had not got to know their companies.</p>

<p>The command of the various units of the
field army was in a bad enough way, for, owing
to the numerous changes in the staff, there were
many newly appointed commanding officers; but
among the reserve troops the case was worse, for
almost all the commanders were fresh men. The
value of even the regular units was still further
diminished by the proportion and class of the
reservists joining. For instance, in some companies
of the 10th&nbsp;Army Corps there were only
sixty regulars, of whom thirty were young
soldiers who had hardly finished their recruitsâ
course; when 150 reservists from the Poltava
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
province were added to this nucleusâall of them
old menâa company lost almost all semblance
of a regular one. The spirit of the Poltava
reservists was at first specially bad, for a number
of these men had taken part in the agrarian
disturbances. Can it be wondered at that, in
such circumstances, reinforcements which arrived
from European Russia, and went into action
straight from the train, were not so useful as
they would have been had proper pains been
taken with them?</p>

<p>What, then, were the motives which induced
the War Minister (General Sakharoff) to act in
this important matter contrary to the recommendations
I had made, both as War Minister
in 1903 and as Officer Commanding the Manchurian
Army in 1904? In a memorandum
written by him on March&nbsp;18, after explaining
his views as to the number of days which he
considered the 10th and 17th&nbsp;Corps would take
on their journey to the front, he stated that if
the reserve units were mobilized in the middle
of April, at the same time as the ordinary units,
as I had asked, they would have to wait an
unnecessarily long time before being despatched,
and that it would be sufficient if reserve units,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>â... having finished their mobilization, had
two or three weeks for field exercises&hellip;. The
units mobilized at the beginning of April would
have to wait some three and a half months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
before being despatched. This, besides taking
the men away prematurely from their spring
work in the fields, would put the War Department
to great and unnecessary expense in maintaining
some 60,000 men. Mobilized units, of
course, do not require so long to settle down.â</p></div>

<p>Thus, in spite of the importance of the matter,
and of the fact that we could have trained well
the men going to the Far East, my request was
refused for financial reasons, and in order that
men who were to be soldiers should not be
taken away at sowing-time! The grounds for
General Sakharoffâs opinion that newly raised
reserve units only required two or three weeks
to shake down instead of three and a half months
are not obvious. Did he not know that the
three-line<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> rifle now in the possession of the army
was quite new to the 2nd Category reservists?</p>

<p>The Easter holidays were early in 1904,
coming on April&nbsp;10. I had asked that the
general mobilization of all reinforcements should
be ordered immediately after the holidaysâ<i>i.e.</i>,
in the middle of Aprilâbut General Sakharoff
fixed the date for a month later; thus the
reservists of the 10th and 17th&nbsp;Corps received
a monthâs less training before their departure for
the front than I had stipulated for. The actual
dates of mobilization were: 10th and 17th&nbsp;Army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Corps, May&nbsp;1, 1904; 5th&nbsp;Siberians,
June 14. The leading Ã©chelons<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> entrained as
follows: 10th&nbsp;Army Corps, May&nbsp;18, 1904;
17th&nbsp;Army Corps, June&nbsp;14; 5th&nbsp;Siberians,
July&nbsp;12. Thus those of the 10th&nbsp;Corps only
had ten days to complete mobilization and get
ready. If from this number be deducted the
days on which reviews were held, it can be seen
that the leading units of this corps could neither
have gone through the shortest musketry course,
nor have carried out any tactical exercises, while
the rest of the corps had only about two weeks
for this important work. The leading Ã©chelons
of the 17th&nbsp;Corps were in a similar plight.
The first units of the 5th&nbsp;Siberians, which
was formed of reserve divisions, had one month
from the day mobilization was ordered till it
entrained. If review days and the time taken
to mobilize be deducted, only a fortnight was
available for instruction and shaking down, and
the whole experience of the war has shown that
this is insufficient, especially for 2nd&nbsp;Category
reservists. Had the troops of the 5th&nbsp;Siberians
only been mobilized at the same time as the
10th and 17th&nbsp;Corps, its leading units would
have had about two and a half months for this
process of preparation. In these circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the efficiency of its regiments would have been
higher in the first fights than they were in
General Orloffâs column at Liao-yang. Another
result of the postponed mobilization was that
the first Ã©chelon of the 10th&nbsp;Army Corps
(9th&nbsp;Division), which arrived at the front on
June&nbsp;30, was much below strength, especially
as regards officers. Not only had the Poltava
reservists not settled down with the regulars,
but in some companies they almost came to blows
with them after the first fights. The regulars
reproached the reservists for leaving the ranks in
action, to which the latter replied: âYou are
soldiers; itâs your job; weâre peasants.â Feeling
between the two classes of men ran so high
that they were with difficulty restrained from
actually fighting. I should in justice add
that these peasants, under the command of
the able and gallant General Hershelman, became
hardened soldiers, and in later battles
fought most gallantly, especially at Mukden.
Units of the 5th&nbsp;Siberian Corps reached the
front with their men in much the same state,
and in the first battles some regiments of this
corps did not display the steadiness they should
have done, but later on, especially at Mukden,
the 51st and 54th&nbsp;Divisions fought splendidly.</p>

<p>Although we had a large number of reservists
at our disposal, instead of mobilizing the youngest,
in some districts we took men of all ages, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
in others we did not discard the elderly men.
Directly they arrived at the front it was noticed
that the older reserve men were both physically
and morally less reliable than the others. Indeed,
according to their officers, they were an actual
source of weakness instead of strength to the
units they joined. Nearly all the men who left
the ranks in action were 2nd&nbsp;Category reservists.
Of course, there were splendid exceptions, but
the one idea of the majority of these men was to
get put on non-combatant duties on the line of
communication, on transport work, or appointed
as hospital orderlies, and after the first fights
they were given their desire. Our peasants
generally put on fat, grow beards, and lose their
soldierly appearance when they get over thirty-five.
Naturally, also, they find the discomforts of
campaigning harder to bear than younger men.
The âLittle Russianâ 2nd&nbsp;Category reservists
of the Poltava province were too heavy to
scramble over steep slopes, and found the Manchurian
hills very difficult to negotiate after the
plains of their native country. The small active
hillmen of Japan had indeed a great advantage
over our soldiers in the July and August
battles. It must also be remembered that
villagers of over thirty-five are generally married
men with large families. Our reservists were
continually thinking of the homes and families
they had left behind, which was not exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
conducive to the cheerful mind so necessary to
the soldier. Added to all this, they did not
understand the reason for the war, and far from
being urged on by their country to deeds of
gallantry, were fed with seditious proclamations,
advising them to kill their officers instead of
fighting. During the retreat from Mukden
several units retired in disorder, and many men
were met who had thrown away their rifles. One
of these was heard by my staff to ask: âWhere
is the road to Russia?â On being told he was a
cowardly cur, he answered: âWhy should I have
to fight? I have got six children to support.â</p>

<p>The partial mobilization proved unsatisfactory,
but it was not merely an accident of the war.
Owing to the enormous extent of our frontiers,
we might have been drawn just as easily into a
European struggle that would have necessitated
a general mobilization as into a war which required
only a partial one. Thus, in addition to
having a plan for general call to arms, we had
to work out different schemes for partial mobilization
to meet certain contingencies. It was
laid down as a basis for these schemes that their
application should not interfere with a general
mobilization if that also proved necessary, so
certain areas had to be selected for the calling
out of reserves which would not interfere with
the general and more important scheme. The
number of these areas could only be kept down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
by taking from them the maximum of reserve
menâ<i>i.e.</i>, those of all categories irrespective of
age. The first scheme for partial mobilization on
these lines was drawn up and approved in 1896,
when General Vannovski was War Minister, and
when it was found necessary, in 1903, to work
out fresh plans in case of complications with
Japan, they were naturally based upon the old
scheme. Having at that time complete faith
in the reliability of the 2nd&nbsp;Category reservists,
I (then War Minister) concurred in the general
lines adopted, and submitted the new plan to the
Tsar for approval, but only as regards the first
reinforcements to be sent to the Far East.
After I had seen the first consignment which
actually reached the front, I asked that no more
2nd Category reservists or men with large
families should be sent. When the second partial
mobilization (54th, 61st, and 71st&nbsp;Divisions)
took place, a half-hearted attempt was made to
reject men with large families; but it was not
till the fifth and sixth mobilizations that 2nd
Category reservists and family men were, by
the Emperorâs wish, left behind. Neither the
people nor the reservists could understand
why 2nd&nbsp;Category reservists with families were
taken from one district or one set of villages,
and bachelors who had only just passed into the
reserve from the colours were rejected in others.
Future schemes for partial mobilization must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
drawn up on entirely different lines from those
of 1896 and 1903. Although 2nd Category
reservists were being sent to the front, we continued
to allow men to pass as usual from the
regular army into the reserve, even letting them
go before they had completed their five years
with the colours. This state of affairs was
extremely harmful to the army, but can be
partly explained as follows:âIn the spring of
1904, just after the commencement of the war,
the recruits of that year should have begun to
join all units in European Russia. In peace,
infantry soldiers are usually passed from the
colours to the reserve at the end of the manÅuvres
when they have done only three years
and a few monthsâ service out of five (four
manÅuvres and three winters). It did not occur
to the Headquarter Staff to make use of these
men for the army in the field, though there were
more than 200,000 of themâyoung soldiers,
splendidly trainedâwho might have been enrolled
in reserve units and then sent as drafts
to the front. In this matter Headquarters were
guided by considerations quite unconnected with
the war. The advisability of retaining in their
regular units the men about to pass to the
reserve was indeed considered, but it was put
down as having many disadvantages. The
political side of the matter was what carried
most weight at Headquarters; moreover, questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
of finance were involved, for the men so retained
with the colours would, upon arrival of the
recruits, have been supernumerary to the establishment.
But, owing to the shortage caused by
the formation of new corps, it was found difficult
to carry out guard and other duties, and in some
units the men due to leave were retained with
the colours till the young soldiers had joined the
ranks. General officers in command of districts
gave various replies when asked for their opinions
on this matter; some were for retaining the
men, others for letting them go. In the summer
of 1904 the War Minister asked the Tsarâs
permission to authorize commanding officers to
pass men of the infantry, field artillery, and
engineers into the reserve if they thought fit,
provided that men were not kept with the
colours longer than March&nbsp;31, 1905. The
transfer in other arms of the Service was to be
as usual. Thus the retention in the ranks of
these time-expired soldiers was the exception,
and was not dependent on the war. Always
fearful of a European war, we replaced the troops
sent from Russia to the front by forming a large
number of new divisions from the reservists.
This course was also necessary for the maintenance
of internal order. On August&nbsp;23, 1904,
officers commanding districts were authorized to
transfer men retained with the colours into the
newly formed infantry and artillery units, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
thus to get rid of the same number of 2nd&nbsp;Category
reservists. Thus the reserve divisions
formed for service in the interior of Russia
began to be filled by good men and rid of
2nd Category men before the divisions at the
front were. In the autumn of 1904, at the
request of the authorities in the field, authority
was given to transfer men retained with the
colours up to March&nbsp;31, 1905, into the units
mobilized and expanded by the seven partial
mobilizations, and to discharge from these units
the 2nd Category reservists and men of large
families. It was only on December&nbsp;27, 1904,
when the young soldiers joined the ranks, that
arrangements were made to transfer the men
retained with the colours into the units that
were not mobilized or expanded. These men
were available for despatch to the front as drafts
in the summer and autumn of 1904, but they
only arrived a year later, after the Mukden
battles, when they were too late. These splendid
men saw no fighting at all.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to explain (<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII.</a>)
on what a large scale the Japanese made use
of their reserve troops, and how rapidly they
replaced casualties. The organization of the
reserve units in the Russian army, on the other
hand, was not fully completed before the war,
for we had only been able to go ahead as funds
permitted. The number of reserve troops in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Far East corresponded to the small number of
units stationed there in the first instance, but
while we increased our numbers out there it was
not considered convenient to increase the reserve
units, the number of reservists living there and
in Siberia being insufficient to fill them. But
if we had had the cadres of a large number of
reserve units there, it would have been easy to
send the reservists to them from European
Russia. The six reserve battalions stationed in
Pri-Amur had lost most of their permanent
cadres in the first fights. The army generally
had to operate with a constantly decreasing
establishment, due to a variety of causes:</p>

<p>1. Units arriving as reinforcements sometimes
came with a shortage of 15 to 20&nbsp;per cent.
among the men, and 25&nbsp;per cent. among the
officers. The 10th&nbsp;Army Corps in particular
arrived very shortâa fact which I immediately
reported to the War Minister.</p>

<p>2. Owing to the shortage of men in the administrative
services and of the auxiliary troops,
many duties had to be carried out by the regiments
in the fieldâ<i>i.e.</i>, duties in rear, at camps,
on the line of communication, at hospitals, in
the commissariat and transport, as well as guards
for the different store depÃ´ts. Advantage was
taken of these duties to get rid of the 2nd&nbsp;Category
reservists.</p>

<p>3. A large number of men had to be told off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to guard property left in the staff quarters of the
Viceroyalty, and the stores, supplies, and droves
of cattle collected for the troops at work on the
railways, bridges, and for other odd duties.</p>

<p>4. On the days of heavy engagements the
shortage increased by tens of thousands, and
even in periods of comparative quiet the number
of killed and wounded in some units was very
high.</p>

<p>5. Sickness.</p>

<p>All these reasons combined necessitated a
continual stream of reinforcements to the front.
But owing to the state of the railway there
were intervals, and fairly long ones, when the
army received no draftsâas, for instance, in
July, August, and September, 1904, when, as
I have already mentioned, we lost 100,000 men,
and only received 21,000.</p>

<p>The advance at the beginning of October,
1904, was made when the army was much below
strength, some regiments having only half, and
even less, of their proper complement. And
this shortage of men was increased on the eve
of a battle by the large numbers left with the
transport, at the staff quarters and as officersâ
servantsâmen who were in reality combatants.
Curiously enough, many commanding officers
showed no particular anxiety to take their units
into action as strong as possible. But what was
most serious was the speed with which some units
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
melted away as soon as they came under fire;
directly casualties happened this dissolution commenced.
Men were told off, with the knowledge
of their commanding officers, to assist company
and divisional stretcher-bearers in carrying the
wounded out of action. If the number of
wounded were large, an enormous number of
unwounded men went to the rear. The cowardly
and the skulkers did their best to get detailed
for this duty, or went off with wounded men
without orders, or left the ranks without any
excuse. I have seen stretchers with wounded
men accompanied by as many as ten unwounded
soldiers. In some regiments the numbers thus
voluntarily retiring from the field amounted to
hundreds; in one regiment<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> more than 1,000
men left the ranks in the first fight in which it
took part. These were generally reservists, and
chiefly those of the 2nd&nbsp;Category. The men
with the colours, as a rule, did most of the
fighting, and fought magnificently; sometimes
even when companies were reduced to a handful
of men they continued fighting. Of course,
there were some gallant men amongst reservists,
but, as a rule, any brave deeds that were performed
were done by the men with the colours
and 1st&nbsp;Category reservists. Even for the drafts,
the men sent to the front were not selected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
adequate care, and many were quite unfit for
active service. In 1905, of some 76,000 who
arrived for the 1st&nbsp;Army, 4,100 were sick or
otherwise unfit. The following statement by the
Adjutant-General of that Army is interesting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>âThe drafts sent to the Army before the
battle of Mukden were composed of 2nd&nbsp;Category
reservists who left the colours about 1887.
They were quite ignorant of the present rifle,
and their training was in other ways far below
the level of the men forming the permanent
cadres of their units. Many of them were
physically quite unfitted to endure the hardships
of a campaign or of any military service, being
chronic sufferers from diseases such as rheumatism.
But those who arrived after the battle
of Mukden were splendid. Reservists were
sometimes drafted to an Arm of the service in
which they had not served before passing to the
reserve; for instance, men were put into the
artillery who had done all their colour service in
cavalry or infantry, while to engineer units were
sent men who had served in the infantry. This,
of course, caused considerable complication as
regards training, and could not but militate
against our field operations, especially in the
case of the technical troops.â</p></div>

<p>The above is an accurate representation of the
facts. Until the battle of Mukden the drafts
sent to the front were much less reliable than
those arriving afterwards, when they were too
late to see any fighting. Those which were
composed of 2nd&nbsp;Category men were often so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
bad that if a fight were imminent, commanding
officers asked to be relieved of them, as their
steadiness could not be relied on. These officers
felt that their more or less veteran units would
do better in the field, even if weak in numbers,
than if filled up just before a fight with these
men. Such a request was made to me by the
officer commanding the 1st&nbsp;Army Corps and
many others.</p>

<p>The shortage of officers was also a bad feature
of our arrangements. In spite of the stream
sent out to replace casualties, many units went
short of their proper complement of officers all
through the war. Both the troops actually in
the Far East and the reinforcements sent out
were at their peace strength when hostilities
commenced. Indeed, there were instances in
the beginning of the war of companies going into
action for the first time commanded by junior
lieutenants. As things went on, this deficiency
in leaders was found to exist even in those units
whose muster rolls showed an excess above their
proper complement, and after the first fights,
owing to the specially heavy casualties among
the officers, cases were quite common of battalions
and companies in action which were
commanded by captains and second lieutenants.
This dearth at the front was increased by the
number of officers absorbed in departmental and
other duties in the rear, and, in the case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
reinforcements, by so manyâboth medical and
combatant officersâbeing left at the different
bases; the latter were, of course, intended, in
case of a general mobilization, to be available
for general or regimental duties with the newly
formed units. These remarks apply more particularly
to the infantry. In the cavalry and
artillery the numbers, though less than the
establishment, were generally sufficient to carry
on with. This was due to the fewer casualties in
those arms. There is no doubt that the question
of providing officers for an army in the field is a
very serious one, which is complicated by many
extraneous circumstances. We found that when
the period of great battles and consequent heavy
losses amongst the officers commenced, the
discrepancy between the number of them shown
on paper and of those actually present with a
regiment rapidly increased. The names of a
large number of wounded and sick were kept on
the rolls for a long time. Some of the wounded
and sick who stayed in the theatre of war
gradually drifted back to their regiments, but
the great number who had gone to Russia remained
there, and did not rejoin even after they
had quite recovered. There were instances
where commanders of regiments, who had gone
to Russia convalescent and had not returned, were
still shown as commanding, and were still drawing
command pay. Several who went home sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
or wounded loafed about the streets of our cities
or large towns for months, and the curious thing
is that no one seemed to question such behaviour.
In spite of what was done to obviate this, the
medical officers and the medical board were far
too lenient to those who wished to return home,
and gave them every facility. On the other
hand, many who were considered incompetent
for field service, and sent back to Russia on this
account, appeared again as fit, and returned to
their corps, thus squeezing out from the command
of companies and battalions those who had
honourably borne all the hardships of the campaign,
had acquired war experience, and had
earned accelerated promotion. An excellent
article on this subject by M. Glinski, called
âThe Resurrected Dead,â was published in the
<i>Razviedchik</i> in 1906. It should be stated, in
fairness to our officers, however, that if many
remained absent who could have returned to the
front, there were a very large number who,
though they had been wounded, made every
effort to rejoin, often, indeed, doing so before
they had quite recovered. Several officers
rejoined after having been wounded two and
three times, and these gallant gentlemen would
have been a credit to any army in the world. In
the 1st&nbsp;Army Corps, over 837 officers who had
been wounded rejoined. For all these reasons
my requests that fresh officers might be sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the army were frequent and persistent, but the
War Ministry were not always able to comply.
They had to collect officers stationed in European
Russia, the Caucasus, and Turkestanâwherever
they could be obtained, and were not always
able to pick and choose. Some of them were
quite useless owing to alcoholism, others to the
irregular lives they had led, while several got
drunk and became violent even on the way out.
Such men stayed at Harbin as long as they could,
did nothing but harm on joining the corps to
which they were appointed, and were eventually
removed. Our most reliable officers were the
regulars, particularly those who volunteered for
the front, many of whom greatly distinguished
themselves. The least reliable were the reserve
officers, who had been removed from the service,
and had managed to squeeze into the reserve
owing to our mistaken kindness.</p>

<p>When I was War Minister I had directed
General Narbut, a member of the Military
Council, to work out a scheme whereby a reserve
of officers might be obtained in war. The
essence of this scheme was that our cadet schools
should, on mobilization, pass out a larger number
of cadets as officers, and should then set to work
to train as soon as possible those officers of the
1st and 2nd&nbsp;Categories who volunteered, and
also the men of the regulars who were possessed
of an intermediate standard of education,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
thousands of whom were good enough to be
given the rank and duties of lieutenant. Why
this scheme was not carried out during the war
I do not know, but unless steps are taken to do
something of this kind in future we shall be in
difficulties. We did not take advantage of the
possibility when war was declared, or even
immediately afterwards, of passing out a greater
number of the senior classes of the military and
cadet schools. In 1902 these colleges supplied
the army with 2,642 officers; we might, therefore,
have received at the beginning of 1904 and 1905
more than 5,000 young officers wherewith to fill
vacancies in the field. This is precisely what the
Japanese did. Foreseeing how we should be
placed, on March&nbsp;19, 1904, I asked the War
Minister that officers might be commissioned
from the military and <i>yunker</i> schools, before the
manÅuvres, at the rate of 2 per battalion,
1 per battery, 4 per Cossack regiment, and
100 to the reserve. This was not done. On my
repeated representations as to the urgent necessity
for increasing the supply, I received in 1904 a
curt reply to the effect that the maintenance of
the number of officers up to establishment was
the duty of the War Minister, not that of the
officer commanding the army in the field. When
the output was eventually increased, we received
only a comparatively small number of those who
had just got their commissions. These formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
a most desirable element in the army, and in the
majority of cases behaved splendidly in action.</p>

<p>On the whole, our troops were, for the reasons
explained, very short of officers in the greater
number of actions. Although the War Department
accomplished a great work in sending out
the large number of officers that did go to the
front, very little discrimination was shown in
their selection. It must be acknowledged, also,
that we made little use either of our non-commissioned
officers in the way of preparing
them to take the places of officers, or of the
splendid material to our hand in the cadets of
the military and cadet schools.</p>

<p>The behaviour of our troops in the field was,
on the whole, excellent, but the further from the
advanced positions they were the worse did their
discipline become. Even at the actual front it
varied with the different classes of men, as I have
explained. Of course, had good discipline prevailed
in the units in which the 2nd&nbsp;Category
reservists served, they would never have been
able to leave the field in action as they sometimes
did. But men, even of the best regiments, when
they saw looting all round them, and acts of
violence being committed with impunity, were
themselves liable to become tainted with the
spirit of lawlessness, and to get out of hand.
This especially applied to the lines of communications,
for strict and uncompromising discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
was maintained in the advanced positions. In
the time of Frederick the Great the saying went
that the soldier should fear the corporalâs cane
more than the enemyâs bullet, but nowadays,
though of course the liability of all to serve has
improved and raised the average moral condition
of the rank and file, it is not easy to make our
uneducated peasantry appreciate what discipline
is. Belief in God, devotion to the Tsar, love of
the Fatherland, are the factors which have, up
till now, welded the mass of soldiers in each unit
into one family, and have made them fearless and
obedient; but these principles have latterly been
much shaken amongst the people, and the result
was, of course, felt in the recent war. It was
chiefly noticeable in an increase in the number of
men who were slack and insubordinate, who
criticized their seniors, and generally exercised
a bad influence on their comrades. Such men
could only be controlled by severity, for fear is
the only thing which appeals to them. But
while this deterioration in the discipline of the
whole nation has been going on, our defence
against it has been weakened, for in the summer
of 1904 corporal punishment had been abolished
in the army even on active service. I supported
its abolition in peace myselfâindeed, conducted
the measure for this through the Military Council;
but many of us thought it unwise to alter the
existing law which authorized its infliction in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
war, for the fear of it kept many bad characters
from crime, and prevented the cowards leaving
the ranks in action. However, our officers were
deprived of this deterrent, and no substitute was
given.</p>

<p>In war such minor punishments as confinement
to barracks or in cells and extra duty are
out of the question. We therefore had no
summary and effective punishment for many
offences, such as insubordination, etc. A certain
number of crimes are punishable with death, but
what is lacking is some adequate punishment
between the capital award and nothing at all.
To make the position worse in our case, men
who had been sentenced to a term of service in
the disciplinary battalions remained on in the
ranks, and at the slightest show of gallantry on
their part our kind-hearted officers asked that
their sentence might be remitted or modified.
As if this were not enough, insubordinate sailors
used to be sent to the army for punishment!
The action of the military courts was unsatisfactory,
their procedure complicated and slow.
The usual result of the withdrawal from commanding
officers of the power to award a flogging
was that they let a man off altogether or else
took the law into their own hands. As a matter
of fact, corporal punishment continued to be
given in certain cases, sometimes on the verdict
of the men and at their own suggestion; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
culprits were beaten with cleaning-rods instead
of canes. Taking into consideration the peculiar
conditions under which this war was conducted,
owing to the want of national sympathy in the
struggle, and to the anti-Government propaganda
which permeated all ranks of the army, this
weakening of the disciplinary powers of officers
was on the whole very ill-advised, and was
carried out without reference to the officers
actually in command of troops.</p>

<p>The reasons for the unpopularity of the war also
affected the steadiness of the troops in action.
Amongst many instances of real gallantry, cases
of cowardice in detachments, and particularly in
individuals, were noticeable. Occasions when
soldiers, and even officers, surrendered when still
unwounded were only too frequent, and they
were, unfortunately, not visited with the full
severity of the law. Many officers, on returning
after release from capture, were not tried by court-martial
at once, but were straightway placed in
command of units going to the front, and then
took command of companies and battalions as
soon as they rejoined. This attitude towards
those of our people who had surrendered could
not but cause bad feeling amongst the best
elements in the army who had been doing good
work all along. This feeling of disgust was particularly
aggravated when it became known that
various persons removed from the army for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
incompetenceâeven for cowardiceâhad received
high appointments in Russia. Such action destroyed
all discipline. For instance, the conveyance
of General Grippenberg by special train
after he had just thrown up his command was
in itself sufficient to encourage insubordination
on the eve of decisive battles; it certainly undermined
the authority of the Commander-in-Chief.
The wholesale criticism pronounced on all ranks
by the Press, the abuse of the officers, particularly
of those in high command, together with the
underhand efforts made to tempt the men not
to fight, but to mutiny and kill their superiors,
undermined their faith in their commanders, destroyed
discipline, and made the troops cowardly
in action. Such a state of affairs was enough to
discount all the efforts of the very best officers,
and had the most evil effect on those who were
already inclined to show the white feather.</p>

<p>War is terrible; therefore the methods of
maintaining discipline amongst troops, to be
effective, must be as terrible. We certainly
desired success, yet how often did we not act so
as to make success improbable, if not impossible?
The very causes which were undermining authority
in the army were those which kept victory
from us. Peace reputations are no criterion of
ability in war, and many commanders who had
been noted throughout their career as âbrilliant,â
âabove the average,â proved in physical strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and force of character of very little use. On the
other hand, those who had remained unnoticed
in the piping times of peace showed great strength
of character and brilliant military qualities amid
the stress of war. Amongst the latter was
General Kondratenko, the hero of Port Arthur.</p>

<p>After the first engagements it was found necessary
to remove from the army as rapidly as possible
those officers who had shown themselves
unfit for their duties, and, without attaching undue
weight to mere seniority, to promote others who
had proved themselves capable soldiers in the
field. On June&nbsp;3, I reported to the War Minister
the unfitness of two generals commanding army
corps then proceeding to the front, but no notice
was taken. Every obstacle was put in the way
of my efforts to get rid of incapable commanders
of army corps and divisions, and amongst other
things I was informed from St. Petersburg that
I asked for commanders of corps to be changed
far too often. My orders removing from duty
a General Officer commanding an East Siberian
Rifle Division, who was liable to attacks of
nerves in action, and left his division before a
certain great battle, drew a series of questions as
to my reasons. As I have mentioned, persons
who had left the army owing to incompetence,
sickness, or even cowardice, sometimes received
high appointments in Russia, and all my recommendations
that gentlemen of this spirit should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
be removed from duty as speedily as possible
were pigeon-holed. To turn to another point,
some regiments were commanded for twelve
months and more, by temporary commanders.
A characteristic example of this kind is the story
of the removal from duty of the officer commanding
one of the Caspian Regiments, Colonel
Fâ. This officer, who was slightly wounded
(contusion) in the first fight in which his regiment
took part, went in the beginning of
October, 1904, to Russia to recover, and only
rejoined after he had been absent nearly a year,
during a considerable portion of which time he
was quite well. In his absence the regiment
was commanded by an excellent officer, a certain
colonel, who was awarded the Cross of St.
George for gallant behaviour when with the regiment
at the battle of Mukden. During those
twelve months I sent in ten recommendations
asking that Colonel Fâ might be gazetted
out of the command, and that it might be given
to the colonel acting for him. When Linievitch
was Commander-in-Chief he supported my
request, adding his own recommendation to mine,
and sending it on to the War Minister and the
Chief of the Headquarter Staff. The latter, however,
did not agree, and asked why Colonel Fâ
[who had then rejoined] was not commanding
the Caspian Regiment. I again sent in my
recommendation, and again received a refusal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
These absolute refusals of my request were the
more inexplicable as I had already received information
that the officer commanding the troops
in the St. Petersburg Military District was not
opposed to the appointment of my nominee.
In the end the long-waited-for appointment
was made, but the Chief of the Headquarter
Staff informed me that it was made at the request
of General Baron Meyendorf, lately commanding
the 1st&nbsp;Army Corps! Several colonels commanding
regiments specially distinguished themselves
in the early engagements, and showed fine
military qualities, and owing to the lack of
brigade commanders I frequently asked that
some of them then in command of regimentsâfor
instance, Lesha, Riedko, Stelnitski, and Dushkevitch
among othersâmight be promoted to
Major-Generals, and I called attention to brigades
in the army that were vacant. The Headquarter
Staff delayed for a long time, continually asking
for further information, and the end of the matter
was that Colonel Ostolopoff, commanding the
Omsk Regiment, a worthy officer, but one who
had in no way distinguished himself in the field,
and whose name came up in the ordinary way,
was promoted before the above-mentioned
colonels.</p>

<p>My recommendations as to giving accelerated
promotion to the best officers of the General
Staff with me were negatived, because these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
gentlemen would then have passed over the
heads of their contemporaries polishing office-stools
in Russia. For example, Captain Kruimoff
was an exceedingly capable officer of the
General Staff on the staff of the 4th&nbsp;Siberian
Corps. General Zarubaeff, his corps commander,
and I several times recommended him for promotion
to Lieutenant-Colonel<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for distinguished
service in the field. We were unsuccessful in
our effort, but, to the amazement of myself and
of the officers of the General Staff who were at
the front, I ascertained that a contemporary of
Zarubaeff, who was not at the war, and who
was not qualified for the promotion, had been
promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. And this was
only one instance of many. As regards the promotion
of captains of infantry of the Line to
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Headquarter Staff, I am
glad to say, made no difficulty, and by this course
we obtained a large number of energetic young
staff officers. Some of them possessed, indeed,
such brilliant military qualities that they might
well have been put at once in command of regiments.
I tried, in the interests of the public
service, to get some officers who were personally
known to me as good men appointed to the
field army. Some were sent to me, others were
not, the reason being given that the strength of
the army was sufficient to satisfy all official needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>To organize intelligence work successfully
special experience is required. I was dissatisfied
with the way this important duty was being performed,
and I asked that a certain officer of the
General Staff, particularly well qualified for it,
should be appointed, but I received a refusal on
quite insufficient grounds. Again, the Headquarter
Staff paid very little attention to what
they allowed to be published from the reports
from the theatre of war, and gave out information
containing the names of localities, units, etc.,
which must have made it easier for the enemy
to fix the position of our troops. At the same
time, though Headquarters knew the totals of
our losses and the numbers of guns we had
abandoned in the fights at Mukden, they for
a long time did not contradict the Press reports
which stated we had lost several hundreds of
guns. The long absences from the army of
officers commanding units compelled me frequently
to ask that a time-limit should be fixed,
after which, if they did not rejoin, the absentees
should forfeit their appointments. This recommendation
was eventually approved, and numerous
general and other officers who had been for
long merely officiating in command of brigades
and regiments were, on the authority of the
Commander-in-Chief, confirmed in their appointments.
But soon afterwards demobilization
began, and an order was then issued from St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Petersburg to the effect that the Commander-in-Chief
was, to the prejudice of his own authority,
to issue an order cancelling his previous ones
making the appointments, because the âresurrected
deadâ thought of returning to the army,
and wished to command the units from which
they had so long absented themselves. It is
essential that such harmful interference from
Headquarters with an army in the field should
be put a stop to, and that full power should be
given to those in actual command on the spot.</p>

<p>I have not alluded to our marked inferiority
to the enemy in technical troops and material.
This chiefly applies to the proportion of sapper
units. With each Japanese division of all arms
was a strong battalion of sappers, while we had
only one to each army corps. But, owing to the
demand for work at one and the same time on
the line of communications, and in constructing
bridges and railways, only two sapper companies
of the battalion were as a rule actually with our
corps. In other words, each division had one
company, a proportion which proved to be quite
insufficient. The Japanese telegraph and telephone
troops were also far more numerous than
ours, and their material was better, and it was
only after the Mukden battles that we were able to
remedy these defects. Owing to their sea transport,
the enemy were of course able to deliver
with far greater ease light-railway material in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the theatre of operations, as well as technical
material for construction of fortifications and for
the attack. It was only after Mukden that we
received an adequate stock of field railways,
wire, cables, explosives, and tools.</p>

<p>In spite of the superiority of our guns, we
made a mistake in having only one type of
shrapnel. We hoped, of course, that it would
give good results when burst on contact<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>; but it
turned out to be ineffective when used in this
way, and for this we paid heavily, as we were unable
properly to prepare by artillery the attack
of even hastily fortified positions. When the
Japanese prepared by artillery for an attack on
a village held by us, they destroyed it in the
most thorough manner. The instructions issued
to Kurokiâs army (in October, 1904) contained
the following remarks regarding our artillery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>âThe enemy has apparently no common shell;
his shrapnel is ineffective, and the splinters do
little damage, as the walls of the shell are too
thin.â</p></div>

<p>For a long time we possessed no mountain-guns,
though we very often had to move by
roads impassable by field-guns when operating
in the hills. The enemy were greatly superior
to us in this point. It was only for the Mukden
battles that we were able to provide a few of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
these batteries to some of our army corps
operating in the hills on the east, but even then
the force under General Rennenkampf was insufficiently
supplied.</p>

<p>The Japanese began the war with no machine-guns.
We had a few machine-gun companies
attached to some of the East Siberian Rifle
Divisions, and in the very first fightâat the
Ya-luâone of these companies attached to the
3rd East Siberian Rifle Division was most
valuable. The Japanese were quick to profit
by this experience, and, after the September
fighting at Liao-yang, put in the field a great
number of these guns of a light, portable type.
These were of great service to them, particularly
in strengthening the defence of hastily prepared
positions held by small numbers of men. The
supply of these guns to our army was carried out
very slowly, and was, in fact, only finished by
the time peace was concluded. The proportion
also was too smallâonly eight per division.</p>

<p>Our four-wheeled transport carts were unsuitable
both for hill-work and for the Manchurian
mud; but my request that two-wheeled carts
should be substituted with the troops to come
from Russia was not heeded. The quantity of
ammunition with the guns was found to be
insufficient for continued fighting. In spite of
the reserves provided, the quick-firing artillery
expended nearly all its ammunition at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
fights of Liao-yang, the Sha Ho, and Mukden,
and replenishment after each of these great battles
was a slow process. We also found the need
for howitzers firing high explosive shell. One
battery for the army arrived as peace was concluded.
Hand grenades, which were an innovation,
were locally improvised, but were not
sufficiently powerful in their action.</p>

<p>In my memorandum, from which I have already
given extracts, submitted before my departure
for the front,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> detailing what was most urgently
required in order to insure success, I emphasizedâ</p>

<p>1. The necessity of ordering ninety-six mountain-guns
in addition to the forty-eight already
ordered on my former recommendation. This
was approved, and the order placed, but it was
not carried out quickly enough.</p>

<p>2. The necessity of despatching without delay
to the Far East eight machine-guns per division
already there and going out.</p>

<p>According to official figures, the following
were ordered and delivered in 1904:</p>

<p>In 1905 a large number of machine-guns were ordered, amongst them
being some Danish ones of inferior design; but during the period the
operations lastedâup to March, 1905âwe had to do as best we could with
a very few machine-guns, without high explosive shell, without
sufficient mountain artillery, and without howitzers. All these had
been supplied, or had begun to be supplied, in 1905; but it was too
late.</p>

north-west, from Varanger Fiord to Pskoff (about 1,350 miles), we
marched with our powerful neighbour Sweden, who possessed an army of
100,000 men. At this disturbed period she was mistress of the country
round the Baltic coasts and of the present province of St. Petersburg,
and possessed in the fortresses of Finland and in the Baltic littoral
an enveloping base for a gradual movement on our Pskoff and Novgorod
provinces. On the west, from Pskoff to Tchigrin (about 1,000 miles),
we marched with Poland, the frontier re-entering like a wedge near
Smolensk to a distance of 300 miles from Moscow. Poland, the ally of
Sweden and Turkey, was Russiaâs natural enemy, for she was in
occupation of our soil in White and Little Russia.  On the south, from
Tchigrin to Azov (about 400 miles), the boundary ran practically
undefined, shared with the Tartar hordes subject to Turkey, who then
possessed an army of some 500,000 men, and a strong fleet on the Black
Sea. From Azov to the Caspian (about 400 miles) our neighbours were
Tartars and nomadic Caucasian mountaineers, who were continually
raiding our borders. Lastly, in Asia our frontier, which was here also
only vaguely defined, marched with that of the Kirghiz tribes and
races subordinate to China.</p>

owing to the proximity of this boundary to St. Petersburg; from Grodno
to Khotin (about 130 miles), due to the absence of natural obstacles
and strong fortresses, and to the propinquity of Prussia and Austria;
on the Caucasian side only a portion lay within our sphere of
influence, and after the annexation of Georgia conflicts became
frequent with the Caucasians; on the Central Asian side, because the
annexation of the Kirghiz tribes, in the time of Anne Ivanovna, had
brought Russia into immediate contact with the Khanates of Khiva,

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
